      "message": "\u003e Doesn\u0027t this print multiple (...), one per line?\n\nYes.\n\n\u003e It would be more interesting IMO to print (...) once per skipped group.\n\nThat would be prettier, but this is not a time for niceness... any chance you would remove your -1 and get this in as is?  It will much simplify trace:transactions output as is already.\n\nYour contribution to further improve this would be most welcome! ;)  BTW: There are already 2 other places in the code doing things like this (Josh\u0027s trace stuff and TOm\u0027s debug), so perhaps a neat little general StackTraceElementCompressor kinda util thing would be useful, some time...",
