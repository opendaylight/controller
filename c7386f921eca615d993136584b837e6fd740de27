Each node connector will have only one edge where that node connector will be head node connector, so wondering this is really required. We can get more then one update related to the same edge, but i believe we don\u0027t have to cache them all, because the latest one is going to be the one that is current state of the edge. I believe neither there is a way to find out the correct order between edge update for same node connector.",
