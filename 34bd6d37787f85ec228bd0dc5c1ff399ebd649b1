      "message": "Hi Michal, any specific reason for removing this flow information? When initially i was implementing this, i also thought of removing it because i felt its duplicate data, but then i was given a suggestion that we should augment all the details which we get from switch because it might be required for various purpose. One use case was for flow reconciliation purpose. Other usecase was, what if someone manually added flow and that doesn\u0027t exist in config data base? Current We augment those flows with specific flow-id in the operational data base. So if you remove this flow information, you will just augment the statistics and there will be no flow details for these kind of flows, which i feel don\u0027t make sense. Let me know your thoughts.",

      "message": "Hi Anil,\nthe only reason I had: when supporting vendor extensions there is vendor augmentation hooked under flow model. In order to pass this augment to md-sal via notification the appropriate augmentation must be used. \nSo we have general augmentation point hooked under the notification model  and vendor augmentation hooked somewhere under the general augmentation.\nNow if such a flow arrives to statistics manager we would have to pull those augmentations and hook their content under statistics flow augment. Which is of different class and here we have no access to vendor class.\n\nThis was the first idea Tony came with and of course if you have a better solution which enables duplicate flow model for statistics and expose vendor augmented models via restconf then I am all ear.",

      "message": "Well i don\u0027t have any alternate solution as of now, but this solution kind of loosing information which we get from switch which can use for various cases as i mentioned above. Also its going to fail lot of integration test cases for restconf + statistics manager. As per this design do we have to this for all the other elements (group/meter etc) that supports experimenters? I think we should discuss this with the openflowplugin team, before we really get rid of these addition data in statistics.",
