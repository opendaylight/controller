      "message": "I dont understand the logic here. Maybe Ryan can help answer this.\nIf the Subnets is designed as a List, it is supposed to take in multiple subnets :-). It seems like the existing code isnt happy with \u003e 1.\nI see that your change has just included the condition for 0 subnets.\n\nBut still, it begs the question of the NB API intent and the backend implementaiton.\n\nIf it is just a implementation restriction, then we have to return appropriate exception atleast. \n\nBadRequest may not be the right one. It should more like. NOT IMPLEMENTED.",

      "message": "This is a side effect of the following API statement:\n\nAn address for the floating ip will be automatically allocated, unless the\nfloating_ip_address attribute is specified in the request body. If the requested\nfloating IP address does not fall in the external network\u0027s subnet range, a 400 error will be returned. If the requested floating IP address is already in use, a 409 error code will be returned.\n\nNow, IIRC, for the floating IP to be automatically allocated there needs to be a single subnet associated with the external network.
