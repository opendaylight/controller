      "message": "OK ... I see, quick local test seems to make that work as well.  Tell you what though - let\u0027s split things into two here, because I think we may be mixing two things?  For the problem I\u0027ve hit in my component tests, bug 7538, the single threaded instead of direct executor for the DataBroker is what does the trick (fixes), this change of executor for store I don\u0027t seem to actually need (to fix that problem), as far as I can see.  So let me simplify this change to be just about the former, so we can get that in, and I\u0027ll raise a 2nd change re. the latter.  I\u0027ll do both right away.",
