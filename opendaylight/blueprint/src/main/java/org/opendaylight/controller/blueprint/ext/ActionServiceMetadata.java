     * This implementation assumes Binding V1 semantics for actions, which means actions are packaged along with RPCs
     * into a single interface. This has interesting implications on working with RpcServiceMetadata, which only
     * handles the RPC side of the contract.
     *
     * Further interesting interactions stem from the fact that in DOM world each action is a separate entity, so the
     * interface contract can let some actions to be invoked, while failing for others. This is a shortcoming of the
     * Binding Specification and will be addressed in Binding V2 -- where each action is its own interface.
