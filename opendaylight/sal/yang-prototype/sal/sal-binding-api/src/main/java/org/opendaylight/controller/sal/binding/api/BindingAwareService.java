 * Session-specific instance of the broker functionality.

 * <p>
 * BindingAwareService is marker interface for infrastructure services provided
 * by the SAL. These services are session-specific, each
 * {@link BindingAwareConsumer} and {@link BindingAwareProvider} usually has own
 * instance of the service with it's own context.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The consumer's (or provider's) instance of specific service could be obtained
 * by invoking {@link ConsumerContext#getSALService(Class)} method on session
 * assigned to the consumer.
 * 
 * <p>
 * {@link BindingAwareService} and {@link BindingAwareProvider} may seem
 * similar, but provider provides YANG model-based functionality and
 * {@link BindingAwareProvider} exposes the necessary supporting functionality
 * to implement specific functionality of YANG and to reuse it in the
 * development of {@link BindingAwareConsumer}s and {@link BindingAwareProvider}
 * s.
