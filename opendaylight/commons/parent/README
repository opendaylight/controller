This contains a dummy parent project. The use case of this is for
example the maven-checkstyle plugin call in commons/opendaylight in
there the plugin references the spaces_tabs_checks.xml from the
parent, it works well for all the childs of commons/opendaylight
artifact but when trying to deploy that one itself it breaks because
the plugin section will still refer to the parent when there is no
parent.
This fake parents allow to still set a parent for the
commons/opendaylight even if pretty much empty or limited to the bare
minimum and yet allow the commons/opendaylight to reference a parent.
