/**
 * Swiss army knife equivalent for reconnect strategies.
 *
 * This strategy continues to schedule reconnect attempts, each having to complete in a fixed time (connectTime).
 *
 * Initial sleep time is specified as minSleep. Each subsequent unsuccessful attempt multiplies this time by a constant
 * factor (sleepFactor) -- this allows for either constant reconnect times (sleepFactor = 1), or various degrees of
 * exponential back-off (sleepFactor > 1). Maximum sleep time between attempts can be capped to a specific value
 * (maxSleep).
 *
 * The strategy can optionally give up based on two criteria:
 *
 * A preset number of connection retries (maxAttempts) has been reached, or
 *
 * A preset absolute deadline is reached (deadline nanoseconds, as reported by System.nanoTime(). In this specific case,
 * both connectTime and maxSleep will be controlled such that the connection attempt is resolved as closely to the
 * deadline as possible.
 *
 * Both these caps can be combined, with the strategy giving up as soon as the first one is reached.
