    <!--  Both registration-watches as well as write-watches will
          log EVERYTHING by default, if we do not constrain any paths;
          therefore we set a fake one to get nothing out-of-the-box;
          please remove this first fake one when you configure this
          to watch what you are really interested in instead: -->
    <registration-watches>/this/will/never/exist</registration-watches>
    <!-- <registration-watches>/neutron-router-dpns/router-dpn-list</registration-watches> -->
    <!-- <registration-watches>/tunnels_state/state-tunnel-list</registration-watches> -->

    <write-watches>/this/will/never/exist</write-watches>
    <!-- <write-watches> /NetworkTopology/Topology</write-watches> -->
