    <!-- Enable or disable transaction context debug. This will preserve the call site trace for
         transactions, so that the original caller of un-close'd() transaction can be identified.
         NB: This is a different property from the equally named one in etc/org.opendaylight.controller.cluster.datastore.cfg;
         that one does something somewhat similar, but serves to include the stack trace on failed transaction submit,
         whereas this one is specific to odl-mdsal-trace's trace:transaction leak troubleshooting command.
