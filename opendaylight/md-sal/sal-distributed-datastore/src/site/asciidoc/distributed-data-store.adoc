= Distributed Data Store implementation

[NOTE]
.This is evolving document

This document is in no sense complete, it describes the intenteded implementation.
It is subject to revisions as feedback is received and as the implementation evolves.

== Overview
The implementation builds on `sal-akka-raft` and adds business logic to
create a strongly-consistent, replicated, `DataTree`. It does this by introducing
a finite state machine to interact with local and remote clients and replicates
this using RAFT. The FSM is built around an internal `InMemoryDataTree` instance,
which holds the actual data being replicated and takes care of performing
individual operations (bundled in transactions) on the data.

It exposes an MD-SAL `DOMDataBroker` interface, which individual applications use,
directly, or via the Binding Adaptor, to perform operations.

The implementation is split into two major blocks:

Backend::
  The actual implementation of the replicated data tree. It is pivoted
  around Shard, a subclass of `RaftActor`, and provides a set of messages for the
  *Frontend* to submit work to the Leader, which is then replicated to Followers.

Frontend::
  The MD-SAL layer, which is co-located with the application accessing
  data stored in the data store. It is responsible for implementing MD-SAL
  `DOMDataBroker` and related interfaces and translate them to messages, which drive
  the Backend. It is also responsible with dealing with common failures occuring
  in communication with the Backend, such as messages getting lost and Shard
  Leader moving in the system, to the extent reasonably possible. In current
  implementation this maps to a ConcurrentDataBroker instance.

Both Backend and Frontend share a common Actor System on the local node. Nodes are
connected together using Akka Clustering. There can be at most one Frontend instance
running in an Actor System. For each individual shard, there can be at most one
instance running in an Actor System.

== Concepts

Shard Name::
  The logical name of a part of the Conceptual Data Tree. It is
  associated with a Shard instance. Each member can run at most one such instance
  for a particular name. For current implementation it is a String, but that can
  change to a more structured identifier (such as YangInstanceIdentifier) in future.

Transaction::
  A set of operations on the data tree which are treated as an
  atomic unit. All operations in a transaction share fate, e.g. either abort or
  complete successfully.

Member Name::
  The name for a logical node participating in Akka Clustering and
  is synonymous to a Actor System instance. For deployment purposes, it is a simple
  String, which uniquely identifies an OpenDaylight instance. This name does not
  change for as long as an instance exists. From deployment perspective, a member
  name can be changed only by removing that member and re-adding it. Any uncommitted
  transactions from a removed member will be lost.

Global History::
  Is the aggregated history of all transactions successfully
  committed in the datastore. It is resilient to concurrent failure of N members,
  if total number of members is (2N + 1).

Local History::
  This is a generalized concept behind a `TransactionChain`. It
  includes all transactions committed in the *Global History* at the point when
  it was created and any transactions submitted in the `TransactionChain`. Local
  History is always tied to a single Frontend incarnation and shares its fate.

[NOTE]
.When does Local History get updated with Global History so that it reflects transactions committed from other Local Histories?

TransactionChain implementations we have today deal with this by rebasing their
Local History when they have no outstanding transactions (e.g. have been
fully merged into Global History). This is problematic under load, because if
a TransactionChain is too busy to run out of outstanding transaction and will
keep retaining the view of Global History as it existed when the TransactionChain
was created -- preventing old state from ever being garbage-collected.

== Client/Leader locality

Akka Clustering provides location independence for actor message exchanges and
the data store could be implemented using a single messaging pattern. This would
(and in fact did) result in an implementation, which performs reasonably well.
Unfortunately it also prevents us from using features available in InMemoryDataTree,
which allows for better splitting of responsibilities between the Frontend and
the Backend by performing many preparatory tasks in the Frontend thread, without
the need for message passing.

Elimination of messaging provides significant improvement in operation throughput
and also application developer experience, as invalid operations are detected
immediately in the calling thread rather than being delivered when an attempt
to commit the transaction is made.

With this in mind, the Frontend/Backend internactions have two distinct patterns,
one used for when the Leader is known to be local and the other used when its
locality is either uncertain or known to be remote.

== Failure modes

As noted in the overview section, all frontend and backend instances operate in
a single Akka Cluster, which is logically composed of per-member actor systems.

This setup results in multiple distinct failure modes which need to be analyzed
separately for ways how they are detected, their effect on both Frontend and Backend
state and recovery strategies taken.

=== Shard Leader Failure
  A shard failure occurs when a Shard actor instance is stopped while it is in
  the RAFT leader state, isolated or not. This failure is detected by the Actor
  System, which will restart the actor. Upon restart, Shard starts in RAFT follower
  state, unable to process Frontend transactions as it could before. Both Frontend
  and Backend actors can observe message loss.

=== Loss of Actor System connectivity
  This failure mode occurs when connectivity between nodes is lost. This is primarily
  detected by message timeouts, where messages to and from remote actors fail
  to arrive. At the logic level this failure cannot be discerned from the remote
  actors being too busy to process the request within the deadline. When a timeout
  occurs the party which sent the request does not know if the request has been
  processed, nor wether that request will be executed at some point in the future.

=== Shard Leader component actor failure
  Shard implementation makes use of child actors to allow horizontal scaling,
  effectively creating a threadpool. Some of these actors track Frontend state
  without persisting it, hence a loss of such an actor means that we have lost
  some state Frontend expects us to have. The failure is detected by the Shard
  actor.

== Dealing with failure modes

=== Backend
  The Backend deals with these by running RAFT, which uses heartbeats and reacts
  accordingly by electing a new leader if necessary. A leader which cannot communicate
  with its followers is prevented from making forward progress. State is reconciled
  when the partition heals. This is possible because each state transition in
  RAFT has a unique identifier (the journal index).

  Shard Leader component actor failures are dealt with in a fail-fast manner, where
  a tombstone for the Frontend component corresponding to the failed actor. Failure
  cause is recorded in the tombstone and all subsequent Frontend messages towards
  that actor are immediately rejected, stating the failure cause.

=== Frontend
  The Frontend needs to deal with this mode by eliminating unknowns to the extent
  reasonably possible, or by propagating any unresolved unknowns to the user
  application.

  In order to achieve this, all state transitions need to have a globally-unique
  identifier and the Backend needs to track which transitions have been acted on.
  This way all state transitions can be made idempotent, e.g. the Backend will ignore
  any state transition if its internal state indicate the transition has already been
  performed.

  Idempotent transitions allow the Frontend to re-send them until it receives
  an authoritative reply from the Backend -- either confirming the state transition
  or rejecting it, hence eliminating the unknown and allowing the Frontend to
  continue operating on well-defined state.

== Identifying state transitions
  Transition identifiers form a namespace from which each transition needs to get
  a unique identifier, which makes allocation a performance-critical part
  of operation and needs to be scaled.

  Transitions are always initiated from the Frontend, hence the responsibility
  for allocating and retiring each transition identifier lies ultimately with
  the Frontend. This matter is slightly complicated by the fact that the Backend
  needs to track transitions efficiently, hence we will define additional rules
  when particular transition identifiers are implicitly retired based on events
  observed by the Backend.

  Due to the scaling requirement, the Transition Identifier namespace is a hierarchical,
  where each level in the hierarchy is treated as a separate namespace, lending
  itself to delegation.

  The first level in the hierarchy is the Member Name where the originating Frontend
  resides. Since Member Names are unique within a cluster, this allows for allocation
  and retirement to be tied to member lifecycle. Allocation and retirement does not
  need to be communicated across members. If a member is removed from a cluster,
  all its Transition Identifiers are immediately retired. A Member may not reuse
  a transition identifier it has used for communication until it has confirmed
  that the Backend has acknowledged its implicit or explicit retirement.

  The second level in the hierarchy is the Frontend Generation number. It is used
  to distiguish Frontend instances on the same member across Frontend restarts.
  We could use Akka Persistence or similar to persist Frontend state, all of the state
  is inherently transitive and high-churn, so persisting it would lead to inferior
  degradation. Every time a Frontend instance is started it is assigned a unique,
  generation number. There are multiple mechanisms how such a number could be obtained,
  such as UUID generation, but it is advantageous to have this number increasing
  monotonically. For this reason we will use a locally-persisted number, which is
  incremented (and persisted once) everytime a Frontend instance is started. We will
  use an unsigned 64bit number, stored as a simple long, but treated as an unsigned
  by using Long.*Unsigned*() methods to interact with it.

  These two levels are combined into a FrontendIdentifier and embedded in every
  message the Frontend sends to the Backend.

  The third level in the hierarchy is Local History identifier, which identifies
  a particular Local History managed by the Frontend. This is a 64bit unsigned
  integer, which is unique for a particular Frontend Generation. It is monotonically
  increasing from 1. Zero is treated as a 'no Local History' marker and is made
  special only to support free-standing transactions without the need to define
  a set of dedicated messages.

  The fourth level is the transaction number. This 64bit number uniquely identifies
  a particular transaction within a Local History. It is also monotonically incremented
  for each transaction created in the Local History.

  These two levels are combined into a LocalTransactionIdentifier, which uniquely
  identifies any transaction originating from a Frontend instance. When combined
  with FrontendIdentifier, it also uniquely identifies any transaction that has
  ever executed in the cluster, e.g. forming a GlobalTransactionIdentifier.

== Persistence model

=== Frontend persistence
  As noted above, implementation of the Frontend Generation requires each member
  to persistently store a single 64 bit counter. To keep the persistence interfaces
  within a member consistent, Frontend uses Akka Persistence to maintain this
  counter across restarts.

  State for running transactions is kept in the Frontend until the backend confirms
  it being completed. If an inconsistency occurs (due to messages getting lost
  or Shard Leader failing), the Frontend will retransmit this state to the Backend.

=== Backend persistence
  The Backend needs to persist and replicate enough state to ensure that Shard
  Leader movement does not render Local Histories inoperable, as that has
  a direct impact on applications, which need to have a state reconciliation
  strategy to deal with this situation. Development of complex strategies cannot
  be expected from most applications, as their developers will implement
  a simple strategy of performing a full state dump into the data store, for
  example by flapping a BGP session. If the Shard Leader movement was caused
  by the leader experiencing performance problems, such a dump could result
  in the new Shard Leader failing for the same reason, which would lead to
  the application not being able to make forward progress.

  In order to achieve this, the Backend needs to persist both the data stored
  by the application and enough metadata about Local Histories and Transactions
  to make state recovery across shard leadership movement possible.

==== User Data persistence
  The Snapshot needs to identify all transactions which have been integrated
  into it. Enumerating all of them is clearly not practical, hence we exploit
  the monotonic nature of identifiers' relationship to Global History. For each
  valid Local History, we only need to store the last transaction number, as
  it implies all previous transactions from that Local History have been accepted
  into Global History. This does not include any Local Histories which have
  been retired by the Frontend, as any attempt to access their state would
  mean use-after-free on Frontend's part. The same holds true of any metadata
  about a Frontend generation -- as soon as the Shard Leader receives a message
  from a newer generation, it can safely discard any metadata mentioning the
  prior generation and consider all its identifiers as retired.

  Each DataTreeCandidatePayload entry needs to contain
  the GlobalTransactionIdentifier of the transaction which has caused the
  delta carried in that entry. This information is used to summarize transaction
  metadata when this entry is snapshotted.

==== Internal state persistence
  The Backend creates a hierarchy of actors to track interactions with the Frontend.
  Information necessary to recreate these actors needs to be persisted within
  the journal. This boils down to existence of Local Histories and the last
  transaction committed for a particular history.

  Whenever a Local History is created on the Frontend, a corresponding actor is
  created on the Shard Leader. Before the leader acknowledges its creation, it
  needs to persist a state transition, identifying the Local History. Whenever
  a Local History is closed down, a corresponding tombstone is stored in the journal.
  The last transaction identifier for a local history is tracked via snapshots
  and DataTreeCandidatePayloads.

  In order to minimize overhead on Followers, the actor hierarchy is not created
  until the actor transitions to Shard Leader state. It only tracks the information
  required.

== Actor model
  Both Backend and Frontend are implemented as a set of cooperating actors. This section
  outlines the structure and how it relates to user application interactions.

=== Frontend actor model
  The current implementation does not have explicit actors, which means that every
  interaction with the Backend is done via Patterns.ask(), which creates implicit
  actors. This model proposes to change that, making the model explicit -- allowing
  us to better track state of interactions.

==== FrontendActor
  FrontendActor acts as the single, root-level actor. It is tied to
  a ConcurrentDataBroker instance. Its resposibility is to maintain the generation
  number (hence it is a PersistentActor), maintain information about individual
  ShardLeader locations and direct this information to its children. It maintains
  a set of LocalHistoryActors and a set of SingleTransactionActors.

  Its responsibility is to talk to ShardManager and propagate information about
  Shard Leader location towards its child actors.

==== LocalHistoryActor
  A LocalHistoryActor is tied to a DOMTransactionChain, maintains all local state
  to it and also tracks its propagation to the Shard Leader. This is not a persistent
  actor.

  It maintains a relationship to its Backend counterpart and routes operations
  (remote) and transactions (local) towards it.

  Requests sent from the frontend to the local history actor are subjects to timeouts.
  If a timeout occurs, the frontend is expected to perform full backend leader
  discovery, contact the leader and reconcile transaction state with it.

  In order to minimize messaging latency while maintaining resiliency to message
  loss (due to TCP connectivity issues), there are two messaging patterns:

  -- Frontend talks to the Shard. This is used during instantiation of a local
     history, as well as state reconciliation after a retriable failure has
     occurred (such as a request timeout).

  -- Frontend talks to the Local History Actor. This is used during transaction
     operation, e.g. when a transaction is being built up. Once the transaction
     is readied, the LHA will send a message to the Shard, which takes ownership
     of that transaction's state. Since this handoff is not observable by
     the frontend (which would require additional round-trip), the Shard
     replicates its responses to the LHA. In case a timeout occurs, the frontend
     will contact the LHA (as that's the last endpoint it knows about), which
     will replay the Shard message.

  Messaging between a Local History Actor and its associated Shard is expected
  to be reliable. This is guaranteed by the parent/child relationship, where 
  Shard is the parent. If a Shard fails, all of its children will be restarted,
  losing all state. If an LHA fails, Shard will be notified with Akka DeathWatch
  pattern.


==== SingleTransactionActor
  A SingleTransactionActor takes care of transactions which are not tied to a
  LocalHistory, e.g. single transactions instatiated via
  DOMDataBroker.newXXXTransaction()). These actors instantiated for each transaction
  separately and get terminated once the transaction is completed, successfully or not.
