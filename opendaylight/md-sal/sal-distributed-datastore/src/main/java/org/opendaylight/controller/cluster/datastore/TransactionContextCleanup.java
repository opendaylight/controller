/**
 * A class that closes remote transactions for a TransactionContext when it's
 * garbage collected. This is used for read-only transactions as they're not explicitly closed
 * by clients. So the only way to detect that a transaction is no longer in use and it's safe
 * to clean up is when it's garbage collected. It's inexact as to when an instance will be GC'ed
 * but TransactionProxy instances should generally be short-lived enough to avoid being moved
 * to the old generation space and thus should be cleaned up in a timely manner as the GC
 * runs on the young generation (eden, swap1...) space much more frequently.
