/**
 * A {@link DOMService} providing access to the conceptual data tree. Interactions
 * with the data tree are split into data producers and consumers (listeners). Each
 * of them operate on a set of subtrees, which need to be declared at instantiation time.
 *
 * Returned instances are not thread-safe and expected to be used by a single thread
 * at a time. Furthermore, producers may not be accessed from consumer callbacks
 * unless they were specified when the listener is registered.
 *
 * The service maintains a loop-free topology of producers and consumers. What this means
 * is that a consumer is not allowed to access a producer, which affects any of the
 * subtrees it is subscribed to. This restriction is in place to ensure the system does
 * not go into a feedback loop, where it is impossible to block either a producer or
 * a consumer without accumulating excess work in the backlog stemming from its previous
 * activity.
