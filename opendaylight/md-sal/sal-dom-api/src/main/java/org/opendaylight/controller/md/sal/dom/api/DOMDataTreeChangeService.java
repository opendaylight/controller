     * <p>
     * You are able to register for notifications  for any node or subtree
     * which can be represented using {@link DOMDataTreeIdentifier}.
     * <p>
     *
     * You are able to register for data change notifications for a subtree or leaf
     * even if it does not exist. You will receive notification once that node is
     * created.
     * <p>
     * If there is any pre-existing data in the data tree for the path for which you are
     * registering, you will receive an initial data change event, which will
     * contain all pre-existing data, marked as created.
     *
     * <p>
     * This method returns a {@link ListenerRegistration} object. To
     * "unregister" your listener for changes call the {@link ListenerRegistration#close()}
     * method on the returned object.
     * <p>
     * You MUST explicitly unregister your listener when you no longer want to receive
     * notifications. This is especially true in OSGi environments, where failure to
     * do so during bundle shutdown can lead to stale listeners being still registered.

     * @param listener
     *            Listener instance which is being registered
     * @return Listener registration object, which may be used to unregister
     *         your listener using {@link ListenerRegistration#close()} to stop
     *         delivery of change events.
