/**
 *
 * Data tree validator, which validates data tree modifications
 * for validity, with option to reject supplied modification.
 *
 * <h2>Implementation requirements</h2>
 *
 * <h3>Correctness assumptions</h3>
 * Implementation SHOULD use only {@link DataTreeCandidate} and provided
 * {@link SchemaContext} for validation purposes.
 *
 * Use of any other external mutable state is discouraged, implementation
 * MUST NOT use any transaction related APIs during invocation
 * of callbacks, except ones provided as argument.
 *
 * Note that this may be enforced by some implementations of
 * {@link DOMDataTreeValidatorRegistry} and such calls may fail.
 *
 * <h3>Correct model usage</h3>
 * If implementation is performing YANG-model driven validation
 * implementation SHOULD use provided schema context.
 *
 * Any other instance of
 * {@link SchemaContext} obtained by other means, may not be valid for
 * associated DataTreeCandidate and it may lead to incorrect validation of
 * provided data.
 *
 * <h3>DataTreeCandidate assumptions</h3>
 * Implementation SHOULD NOT make any assumptions on {@link DataTreeCandidate}
 * being successfully committed, even if validate method finished correctly,
 * because other validation mechanism or other {@link DOMDataTreeValidator} may
 * reject proposed {@link DataTreeCandidate}.
