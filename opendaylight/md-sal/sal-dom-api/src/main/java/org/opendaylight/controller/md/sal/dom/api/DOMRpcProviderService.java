/**
 * A {@link DOMService} which allows registration of RPC implementations with a conceptual router. The client
 * counterpart of this service is {@link DOMRpcService}.
 *
 * <p>
 * This interface supports both RFC6020 RPCs and RFC7950 actions (formerly known as 'Routed RPCs'. Invocation for
 * RFC6020 RPCs is always based on an empty context reference. Invocation of actions requires a non-empty context
 * reference and is matched against registered implementations as follows:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>First, attempt to look up the implementation based on exact match. If a match is found the invocation is
 *         on that implementation, returning its result.</li>
 *     <li>Second, attempt to look up the implementation which registered for empty context reference. If a such an
 *         implementation exists, invoke that implementation, returning its result</li>
 *     <li>Throw {@link DOMRpcImplementationNotAvailableException}
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * All implementations are required to perform these steps as specified above.
