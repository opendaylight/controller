/**
 * A data producer context. It allows transactions to be submitted to the subtrees
 * specified at instantiation time. At any given time there may be a single transaction
 * open. It needs to be either submitted or cancelled before another one can be open.
 * Once a transaction is submitted, it will proceed to be committed asynchronously.
 *
 * <p>
 * Each instance has  an upper bound on the number of transactions which can be in-flight,
 * once that capacity is exceeded, an attempt to create a new transaction will block
 * until some transactions complete.
 *
 * <p>
 * Each {@link DOMDataTreeProducer} can be in two logical states, bound and unbound,
 * which define the lifecycle rules for when is it legal to create and submit transactions
 * in relationship with {@link DOMDataTreeListener} callbacks.
 *
 * <p>
 * When a producer is first created, it is unbound. In this state the producer can be
 * accessed by any application thread to allocate or submit transactions, as long as
 * the 'single open transaction' rule is maintained. The producer and any transaction
 * object MUST NOT be accessed, directly or indirectly, from a {@link DOMDataTreeListener}
 * callback.
 *
 * <p>
 * When a producer is referenced in a call to {@link DOMDataTreeService#registerListener(DOMDataTreeListener,
 * java.util.Collection, boolean, java.util.Collection)},
 * an attempt will be made to bind the producer to the specified {@link DOMDataTreeListener}.
 * Such an attempt will fail the producer is already bound, or it has an open transaction.
 * Once bound, the producer can only be accessed from within the {@link DOMDataTreeListener}
 * callback on that particular instance. Any transaction which is not submitted by the
 * time the callback returns will be implicitly cancelled. A producer becomes unbound
 * when the listener it is bound to becomes unregistered.
 *
 * @deprecated Use {@link org.opendaylight.mdsal.dom.api.DOMDataTreeProducer} instead.
