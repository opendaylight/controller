/**
 *
 * Data tree validator, which validates data tree modifications for validity,
 * with option to reject supplied modification.
 *
 * <h2>Implementation requirements</h2>
 *
 * <h3>Correctness assumptions</h3> Implementation SHOULD use only
 * {@link ModifiedDataRoot} for validation purposes.
 *
 * Use of any other external mutable state is discouraged, implementation MUST
 * NOT use any transaction related APIs during invocation of callbacks, except
 * ones provided as argument.
 *
 * Note that this may be enforced by some implementations of
 * {@link DataValidatorRegistry} and such calls may fail.
 *
 * <h3>Correct model usage</h3> If implementation is performing YANG-model
 * driven validation implementation SHOULD use provided schema context.
 *
 * Any other instance of {@link SchemaContext} obtained by other means, may not
 * be valid for associated DataTreeCandidate and it may lead to incorrect
 * validation of provided data.
 *
 * <h3>Modified Data Root assumptions</h3>
 *
 * Implementation SHOULD NOT make any assumptions on {@link ModifiedDataRoot}
 * being successfully committed, even if validate method finished correctly,
 * because other validation mechanism or other {@link DataValidator} may reject
 * proposed {@link ModifiedDataRoot}.
