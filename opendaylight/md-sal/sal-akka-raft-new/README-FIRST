Instructions on generating the protocol buffer Java source files

These instructions are developers who are planning to generate the protocolbuffer java source files.

1. We are using protocol buffer version 2.5.0 - you need to install the exact same version on your box.
The download link is https://code.google.com/p/protobuf/downloads/list. Download .tar/zip based on
your OS.

2. Once downloaded the tar/zip and extracted follow the README instructions to compile protoc on your
machine

3. Create your .proto (IDL) file in resources folder. Give appropriate package name so that the source
   get generation in proper packages. For more information  check
   https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/javatutorial

   For detailed information https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/java-generated

4. To generate the java source files execute in sal-protocolbuffer-encoding directory
   just run.sh in sal-protocolbuffer-encoding or execute the following command

 protoc --proto_path=src/main/resources --java_out=src/main/java src/main/resources/*.proto

5. Run mvn clean install  & build the .jar

6. !!!WARNING!!! - never edit the generated sources files of protocol buffer

7. !!!NOTE!!! if you are planning to add new .proto file  option java_package should begin with
   org.opendaylight.controller.protobuff.messages to properly exclude from sonar.
