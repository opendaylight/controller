/**
 *
 * Marker interface for stateful read view of the data tree.
 *
 * <p>
 * View of the data tree is a stable point-in-time snapshot of the current data tree state when
 * the transaction was created. It's state and underlying data tree
 * is not affected by other concurrently running transactions.
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Implementation Note:</b> This interface is not intended to be implemented
 * by users of MD-SAL, but only to be consumed by them.
 *
 * <h2>Transaction isolation example</h2>
 * Lets assume initial state of data tree for <code>PATH</code> is <code>A</code>.
 *
 * <pre>
 * txRead = broker.newReadOnlyTransaction();   // read Transaction is snapshot of data
 * txWrite = broker.newReadWriteTransactoin(); // concurrent write transaction
 *
 * txRead.read(OPERATIONAL,PATH).get();        // will return Optional containing A
 * txWrite = broker.put(OPERATIONAL,PATH,B);   // writes B to PATH
 *
 * txRead.read(OPERATIONAL,PATH).get();        // still returns Optional containing A
 *
 * txWrite.commit().get();                     // data tree is updated, PATH contains B
 * txRead.read(OPERATIONAL,PATH).get();        // still returns Optional containing A
 *
 * txAfterCommit = broker.newReadOnlyTransaction(); // read Transaction is snapshot of new state
 * txAfterCommit.read(OPERATIONAL,PATH).get(); // returns Optional containing B;
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> example contains blocking calls on future only to illustrate
 * that action happened after other asynchronous action. Use of blocking call
 * {@link com.google.common.util.concurrent.ListenableFuture#get()} is discouraged for most
 * uses and you should use
 * {@link com.google.common.util.concurrent.Futures#addCallback(com.google.common.util.concurrent.ListenableFuture, com.google.common.util.concurrent.FutureCallback)}
 * or other functions from {@link com.google.common.util.concurrent.Futures} to
 * register more specific listeners.
 *
 * @param <P>
 *            Type of path (subtree identifier), which represents location in
 *            tree
 * @param <D>
 *            Type of data (payload), which represents data payload
