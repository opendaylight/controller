/**
 * Write transaction provides mutation capabilities for a data tree.
 *
 * <p>
 * Initial state of write transaction is a stable snapshot of the current data tree.
 * The state is captured when the transaction is created and its state and underlying
 * data tree are not affected by other concurrently running transactions.
 * <p>
 * Write transactions are isolated from other concurrent write transactions. All
 * writes are local to the transaction and represent only a proposal of state
 * change for the data tree and it is not visible to any other concurrently running
 * transaction.
 * <p>
 * Applications make changes to the local data tree in the transaction by via the
 * <b>put</b>, <b>merge</b>, and <b>delete</b> operations.
 *
 * <h2>Put operation</h2>
 * Stores a piece of data at a specified path. This acts as an add / replace
 * operation, which is to say that whole subtree will be replaced by the
 * specified data.
 * <p>
 * Performing the following put operations:
 *
 * <pre>
 * 1) container { list [ a ] }
 * 2) container { list [ b ] }
 * </pre>
 *
 * will result in the following data being present:
 *
 * <pre>
 * container { list [ b ] }
 * </pre>
 * <h2>Merge operation</h2>
 * Merges a piece of data with the existing data at a specified path. Any pre-existing data
 * which is not explicitly overwritten will be preserved. This means that if you store a container,
 * its child lists will be merged.
 * <p>
 * Performing the following merge operations:
 *
 * <pre>
 * 1) container { list [ a ] }
 * 2) container { list [ b ] }
 * </pre>
 *
 * will result in the following data being present:
 *
 * <pre>
 * container { list [ a, b ] }
 * </pre>
 *
 * This also means that storing the container will preserve any
 * augmentations which have been attached to it.
 *
 * <h2>Delete operation</h2>
 * Removes a piece of data from a specified path.
 * <p>
 * After applying changes to the local data tree, applications publish the changes proposed in the
 * transaction by calling {@link #submit} on the transaction. This seals the transaction
 * (preventing any further writes using this transaction) and submits it to be
 * processed and applied to global conceptual data tree.
 * <p>
 * The transaction commit may fail due to a concurrent transaction modifying and committing data in
 * an incompatible way. See {@link #submit} for more concrete commit failure examples.
 * <p>
 * <b>Implementation Note:</b> This interface is not intended to be implemented
 * by users of MD-SAL, but only to be consumed by them.
 *
 * @param <P>
 *            Type of path (subtree identifier), which represents location in
 *            tree

     * <h2>Failure scenarios</h2>
     * <p>
     * Transaction may fail because of multiple reasons, such as
     * <ul>
     * <li>Another transaction finished earlier and modified the same node in a
     * non-compatible way (see below). In this case the returned future will fail with an
     * {@link OptimisticLockFailedException}. It is the responsibility of the
     * caller to create a new transaction and submit the same modification again in
     * order to update data tree. <i><b>Warning</b>: In most cases, retrying after an
     * OptimisticLockFailedException will result in a high probability of success.
     * However, there are scenarios, albeit unusual, where any number of retries will
     * not succeed. Therefore it is strongly recommended to limit the number of retries (2 or 3)
     * to avoid an endless loop.</i>
     * </li>
     * <li>Data change introduced by this transaction did not pass validation by
     * commit handlers or data was incorrectly structured. Returned future will
     * fail with a {@link DataValidationFailedException}. User should not retry to
     * create new transaction with same data, since it probably will fail again.
     * </li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * <h3>Change compatibility</h3>
     *
     * There are several sets of changes which could be considered incompatible
     * between two transactions which are derived from same initial state.
     * Rules for conflict detection applies recursively for each subtree
     * level.
     *
     * <h4>Change compatibility of leafs, leaf-list items</h4>

     * which are based on same initial state, Tx 1 completes successfully
     * before Tx 2 is submitted.

     *
     * <h4>Conflict of two transactions</h4>
     *
     * This example illustrates two concurrent transactions, which derived from
     * same initial state of data tree and proposes conflicting modifications.
     *
     * <pre>
     * txA = broker.newWriteTransaction(); // allocates new transaction, data tree is empty
     * txB = broker.newWriteTransaction(); // allocates new transaction, data tree is empty
     *
     * txA.put(CONFIGURATION, PATH, A);    // writes to PATH value A
     * txB.put(CONFIGURATION, PATH, B)     // writes to PATH value B
     *
     * ListenableFuture futureA = txA.submit(); // transaction A is sealed and submitted
     * ListenebleFuture futureB = txB.submit(); // transaction B is sealed and submitted
     * </pre>
     *
     * Commit of transaction A will be processed asynchronously and data tree
     * will be updated to contain value <code>A</code> for <code>PATH</code>.
     * Returned {@link ListenableFuture} will successfully complete once
     * state is applied to data tree.
     *
     * Commit of Transaction B will fail, because previous transaction also
     * modified path in a concurrent way. The state introduced by transaction B
     * will not be applied. Returned {@link ListenableFuture} object will fail
     * with {@link OptimisticLockFailedException} exception, which indicates to
     * client that concurrent transaction prevented the submitted transaction from being
     * applied.

     *         derived from TransactionCommitFailedException.
     *
     * @throws IllegalStateException
     *             if the transaction is not {@link TransactionStatus#NEW}
