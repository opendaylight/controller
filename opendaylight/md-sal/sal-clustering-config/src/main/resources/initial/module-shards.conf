# This file describes which shards live on which members
# The format for a module-shards is as follows,
# {
#    name = "<friendly_name_of_the_module>"
#    shards = [
#        {
#            name="<any_name_that_is_unique_for_the_module>"
#            replicas = [
#                "<name_of_member_on_which_to_run>"
#            ]
#     ]
# }
#
# For Helium we support only one shard per module. Beyond Helium
# we will support more than 1
# The replicas section is a collection of member names. This information
# will be used to decide on which members replicas of a particular shard will be
# located. Once replication is integrated with the distributed data store then
# this section can have multiple entries.
