      "message": "When reviewing this, I struggled why you would convert a String based file path into a io.File just to then afterwards immediately do a String-based check on it? Then I realized that you may have done this in order to abstract away from platform differences re. File.separate, the eternal PITA of \u0027/\u0027 vs \u0027\\\u0027, yes? If I interpreted that right, then perhaps a small in-line comment Ã  la \"// Normalize to avoid File.separator \u0027/\u0027 VS \u0027\\\u0027 issues would clarify.\n\nI\u0027ve also hesitated for a moment whether this new File of a relative path, which in Java could turn into something based on the current working directory, if you asked it for its absolute path, could ever be an issue in this context, but I don\u0027t see how, so you should be good.",

      "message": "Originally I converted to File with the intention of getting just the path portion sans file name in order to do endsWith. But I didn\u0027t see a method to get just the path although I could\u0027ve done lastIndexOf separator. I realized I didn\u0027t really need the File anymore after submitting but didn\u0027t bother to change it. Shouldn\u0027t matter either way.",
