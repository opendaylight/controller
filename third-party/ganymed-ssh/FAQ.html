<hr><a name="env"></a><h2>When I start program XYZ with putty (or openssh, ..., whatever) then everything
works. However, if I use "Session.execCommand", then XYZ behaves differently or does not work at all!</h2>

<h3>Short answer:</h3>

<p>
The most often source of problems when executing a command with <tt>Session.execCommand()</tt>
are missing/wrong set environment variables on the remote machine. Make sure that the minimum needed
environment for XYZ is the same, independentely on how the shell is being invoked.
</p>

<p>
Example quickfix for bash users:
</p>

<p>
<ol>
<li>Define all your settings in the file <tt><b>~/.bashrc</b></tt></li>
<li>Make sure that the file <tt><b>~/.bash_profile</b></tt> only contains the line <tt><b>source
~/.bashrc</b></tt>.</li>
<li>Before executing <tt>Session.execCommand()</tt>, do NOT aquire any type of pseudo terminal in the
session. Be prepared to consume stdout and stderr data.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
<b>Note:</b> If you really want to mimic the behavior of putty, then don't use Session.execCommand(), 
instead aquire a pty (pseudo terminal) and then start a shell (use <tt>Session.requestPTY()</tt> and
<tt>Session.startShell()</tt>). You then have to communicate with the shell process at the other end
through stdin and stdout. However, you also have to implement terminal logic (e.g., escape sequence
handling (unless you use a "dumb" pty), "expect-send" logic (output parsing, shell prompt detection), etc.).
</p>

<h3>Long answer:</h3>

<p>
If you login by using putty, then putty will normally request a "xterm" pty and your assigned shell
(e.g., bash) will be started (a so called "interactive login shell"). In contrast, if you use
<tt>Session.execCommand()</tt> to start a command then (unless you ask for it) no pty will be aquired
and the command will be given to the shell as an argument (with the shell's "-c" option).
</p>

<p>
The way a shell is being invoked has an effect on the set of initialization files which will be read be the shell.
</p>

<p>
To demonstrate the difference, try the following (from the command line, e.g., with an OpenSSH client):
</p>

<p>
<ol>
<li>Login interactively and print the environment with the "env" command:<br>&nbsp;<br>
<tt><b>[user@host ~] ssh 127.0.0.1<br>
[user@host ~] env</b></tt><br>&nbsp;<br>
</li>
<li>Let the ssh server execute the "env" command (equivalent to using <tt>Session.executeCommand()</tt>):<br>&nbsp;<br>
<tt><b>[user@host ~] ssh 127.0.0.1 "env"</b></tt>
</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
If you compare the two outputs, then you will (unless you have adjusted your shell's settings)
observe different environments.
</p>

<p>
<b>If you are interested in the details, then please read the <tt>INVOCATION</tt> section in man page
for the bash shell. You may notice that the definitions of "interactive" and "non-interactive" 
(and combinations with "login") are little bit tricky.</b>

<hr><a name="blocking"></a><h2>My program sometimes hangs when I only read output from stdout!
Or: can you explain me the story about the shared stdout/stderr window in the SSH-2 protocol?
Or: what is this "StreamGobbler" thing all about?</h2>

<p>
In the SSH-2 low level protocol, each channel (e.g., session) has a receive window. When the remote
SSH daemon has filled up our receive window, it must wait until we have consumed the input and are ready to accept new data.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, the SSH-2 protocol defines a shared window for stderr and stdout. As a consequence,
if, for example, the remote process produces a lot of stderr data and you never consume it, then after
some time the local receive window will be full and the sender is blocked. If you then try to read()
from stdout, your call will be blocked: there is no stdout data (locally) available and the SSH daemon
cannot send you any, since the receive window is full (you would have to read some stderr data first
to "free" up space in the receive window).
</p>

<p>
Fortunately, Ganymed SSH-2 uses a 30KB window - the above described scenario should be very rare.
</p>

<p>
Many other SSH-2 client implementations just blindly consume any remotely produced data into a buffer
which gets automatically extended - however, this can lead to another problem: in the extreme case
the remote side can overflow you with data (e.g., leading to out of memory errors).
</p>

<p>
What can you do about this?
</p>

<p>
<ol>
<li><b>Bad: Do nothing</b> - just work with stderr and stdout Inputstreams and hope that the 30KB
window is enough for your application.</li>

<li><b>Better, recommended for most users:</b> use two worker threads that consume remote stdout
and stderr in parallel. Since you probably are not in the mood to program such a thing, you can use
the StreamGobbler class supplied with Ganymed SSH-2. The Streamgobbler is a special InputStream that
uses an internal worker thread to read and buffer internally all data produced by another InputStream.
It is very simple to use:<br> <tt><b><pre>InputStream stdout = new StreamGobbler(mysession.getStdout());

InputStream stderr = new StreamGobbler(mysession.getStderr());</pre></b></tt>
You then can access stdout and stderr in any order, in the background the StreamGobblers will
automatically consume all data from the remote side and store in an internal buffer.</li>

<li><b>Advanced:</b> you are paranoid and don't like programs that automatically extend buffers
without asking you. You then have to implement a state machine. The condition wait facility offered by
<tt>Session.waitForCondition()</tt> is exactly what you need: you can use it to wait until either stdout
or stderr data has arrived and can be consumed with the two InputStreams. You can either use the return value
of <tt>Session.waitForCondition()</tt> or check with <tt>InputStream.available()</tt>
(for stdout and stderr) which InputStream has data available (i.e., a <tt>read()</tt> call will not block).
Be careful when wrapping the InputStreams, also do not concurrently call read() on the InputStreams while calling
<tt>Session.waitForCondition()</tt> (unless you know what you are doing).<br>Please have a look a the
<tt>SingleThreadStdoutStderr.java</tt> example.</li>

<li><b>The lazy way:</b> you don't mind if stdout and stderr data is being mixed into the same
stream. Just allocate a "dumb" pty and the server will hopefully not send you any data on the stderr
stream anymore. <b>Note:</b> by allocating a pty, the shell used to execute the command will probably 
behave differently in terms of initialization (see also <a href="#env">this question</a>).</li>
</ol>

<hr><a name="buffered"></a><h2>Why are the session's Input- and OutputStreams not buffered?</h2>

<p>
If you need it, then this library offers quite a raw type of access to the SSH-2 protocol stack.
Of course, many people don't need that kind of low level access. If you need buffered streams,
then you should the do the same thing as you would probably do with the streams of a TCP socket:
wrap them with instances of BufferedInputStream and BufferedOutputStream. In case you use
StreamGobblers for the InputStreams, then you don't need any additional wrappers, since the
StreamGobblers implement buffering already.
</p>
<p>
This code snippet will probably work well for most people:
</p>
<p>
<tt>
<pre>
InputStream stdout = new StreamGobbler(mysession.getStdout());
InputStream stderr = new StreamGobbler(mysession.getStderr());
OutputStream stdin = new BufferedOutputStream(mysession.getStdin(), 8192);
</pre>
</tt>
</p>

<hr><a name="sessioncommands"></a><h2>Why can't I execute several commands in one single session?</h2>
<p>
If you use <tt>Session.execCommand()</tt>, then you indeed can only execute only one command per session.
This is not a restriction of the library, but rather an enforcement by the underlying SSH-2 protocol
(a <tt>Session</tt> object models the underlying SSH-2 session).
</p>
<p>
There are several solutions:
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Simple: Execute several commands in one batch</b>, e.g., something like <tt>Session.execCommand("echo
Hello && echo again")</tt>.</li>
<li><b>Simple: The intended way: simply open a new session for each command</b> - once you have opened a
connection, you can ask for as many sessions as you want, they are only a "virtual" construct.</li>
<li><b>Advanced: Don't use <tt>Session.execCommand()</tt>, but rather aquire a shell with
<tt>Session.startShell()</tt></b>. See also <a href="#env">this question</a>.</li>
</ul>
</p>


[<a href="#oben">TOP</a>]

<hr><a name="sessionlimit"></a><h2>I cannot open more than 10 concurrent sessions (or SCP clients).</h2>
<p>
You are probably using OpenSSH. By looking at their source code you will find out that there
is a hard-coded constant called MAX_SESSIONS in the session.c file which is set to "10" by default.
This is a per connection limit. Unfortunately, it is not a run-time tunable parameter.
However, this limit has no effect on the number of concurrent port forwardings. Please note: this information
is based on the OpenSSH 4.3 release.
</p>
<p>
Possible solutions:
<ul>
<li>(a) Recompile your SSH daemon</li>
<li>(b) Try to live with this limit and keep the number of concurrent sessions <= 10.</li>
<li>(c) Distribute your sessions over multiple concurrent SSH connections.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Just for completeness: starting from release 210, the thrown exception may look as follows:<br>
<tt>
<pre>
java.io.IOException: Could not open channel (The server refused to open the channel (SSH_OPEN_ADMINISTRATIVELY_PROHIBITED, 'open failed'))
</pre>
</tt>
</p>

<hr><a name="passwordauth"></a><h2>Password authentication fails, I get "Authentication method password
not supported by the server at this stage".</h2>

<p>
Many default SSH server installations are configured to refuse the authentication type "password".
Often, they only accept "publickey" and "keyboard-interactive". You have different options:
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Enable password authentication.</b> E.g., in case of OpenSSH on Fedora, edit
<code>/etc/sshd/sshd_config</code> and change the value of "PasswordAuthentication" to "yes",
then send a HUP signal to the daemon so that it re-reads its configuration.</li>
<li><b>Switch to public-key authentication.</b> Probably the best choice.</li>
<li><b>Try to use keyboard-interactive authentication.</b> If you have a GUI that interacts with a user,
then this is doable (check out the SwingShell.java example).</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
In general it is a good idea to call either <code>Connection.getRemainingAuthMethods()</code>
or <code>Connection.isAuthMethodAvailable()</code> before using a certain authentication method.
</p>

<p>
Please note that most servers let you in after one successful authentication step. However, in rare cases
you may encounter servers that need several steps. I.e., if one of the <code>Connection.authenticateWithXXX()</code>
methods returns <code>false</code> and <code>Connection.isAuthenticationPartialSuccess()</code> returns
<code>true</code>, then further authentication is needed. For each step, to find out which authentication methods
may proceed, you can use either the <code>Connection.getRemainingAuthMethods()</code> 
or the <code>Connection.isAuthMethodAvailable()</code> method. Again, please have a look into the
SwingShell.java example.
</p>

<hr><a name="puttygen"></a><h2>Why does public key authentication fail with my putty key?</h2>
<p>
When using putty private keys (e.g., .ppk files) with public key authentication, you get a
"Publickey authentication failed" exception. The reason is that the library currently is not able to
directly handle private keys in the proprietary format used by putty. However, you can use the
"puttygen" tool (from the putty website) to convert your key to the desired format: load your key,
then go to the conversions menu and select "Save OpenSSH key" (which saves the key in openssl PEM format,
e.g., call it "private.pem").
</p>

<hr><a name="catmethod"></a><h2>I am sending data to a remote file using the "cat" method, but not all data is being written.</h2>
<p>
Please read carefully the answer to the following <a href="#pumptoremote">question</a>.
</p>

[<a href="#oben">TOP</a>]


<hr><a name="pumptoremote"></a><h2>I want to pump data into a remote file, but the amount of data to be sent
is not known at the time the transfer starts.</h2>
<p>
The SCP protocol communicates the amount of data to be sent at the start of the transfer,
so SCP remains out of consideration. Possible other solutions:
<ul>
<li>Use the SFTP client. Recommended.</li>
<li>Execute "cat > filename.txt" on the remote side and pump the data into stdin. This method is NOT recommended (and won't work on Windows...).</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Be careful if you use the "cat" approach, as it may happen that not all your data will be
written. If you close the stdin stream and immediatelly close the session (or the whole connection) then
some SSH servers do not send the pending data to the process being executed ("cat" in this case).
You have to wait until "cat" has received the EOF and terminates before closing the session. However,
waiting for the termination may not always work, since SSH servers sometimes "forget" to send the exit code
of the remote process. The following code MAY work:
</p>
<p>
<tt>
<pre>
Session sess = conn.openSession();
sess.execCommand("cat > test.txt");
OutputStream stdin = sess.getStdin();

... out.write(...) ... out.write(...) ...

/* The following flush() is only needed if you wrap the  */
/* stdin stream (e.g., with a BufferedOutputStream).     */
out.flush();

/* Now let's send EOF */
out.close();

/* Let's wait until cat has finished                     */
sess.waitForCondition(ChannelCondition.EXIT_STATUS, 2000);
/* Better: put the above statement into a while loop!    */
/* In ANY CASE: read the Javadocs for waitForCondition() */

/* Show exit status, if available (otherwise "null")     */
System.out.println("ExitCode: " + sess.getExitStatus());
/* Now its hopefully safe to close the session           */
sess.close();
</pre>
</tt>
</p>
<p>
(Just a thought for another solution: execute <code>cat > test.txt && echo "FINISHED"</code>
and wait until you get "FINISHED" on stdout... - try it on your own risk =)
