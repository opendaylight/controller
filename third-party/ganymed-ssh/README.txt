Ganymed SSH-2 for Java - build 261
==================================

https://code.google.com/p/ganymed-ssh-2/

Ganymed SSH-2 for Java is a library which implements the SSH-2 protocol in pure Java
(tested on J2SE 5 and 6). It allows one to connect to SSH servers from within
Java programs. It supports SSH sessions (remote command execution and shell access),
local and remote port forwarding, local stream forwarding, X11 forwarding, SCP and SFTP.
There are no dependencies on any JCE provider, as all crypto functionality is included.

There is also a basic (preliminary) SSH server implementation included.

Ganymed SSH-2 for Java was originally developed by Christian Plattner for the Ganymed
replication project and a couple of other projects at the IKS group at ETH Zurich (Switzerland).

These days, the code is maintained by Dr. Christian Plattner and David Kocher.

This distribution contains the source code, examples, javadoc and the FAQ.
It also includes a pre-compiled jar version of the library which is ready to use.
