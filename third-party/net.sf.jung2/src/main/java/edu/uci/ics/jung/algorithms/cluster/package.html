Mechanisms for identifying clusters in graphs.  Where these clusters define disjoint sets of vertices, 
they may be used to define a <code>VertexPartition</code> for more convenient manipulation of the vertex/set
relationships.

Current clustering algorithms include:
<ul>
<li/><code>BicomponentClusterer</code>: finds all subsets of vertices for which at least
2 vertices must be removed in order to disconnect the induced subgraphs.
<li/><code>EdgeBetweennessClusterer</code>: identifies vertex clusters by removing the edges of the highest
'betweenness' scores (see the importance/scoring package).
<li/><code>VoltageClusterer</code>: Clusters vertices based on their ranks as 
calculated by <code>VoltageRanker</code>. 
<li/><code>WeakComponentVertexClusterer</code>: Clusters vertices based on their membership in weakly 
connected components of a graph.
</ul>
