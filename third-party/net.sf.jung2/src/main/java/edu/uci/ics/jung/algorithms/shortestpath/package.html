<body>

Provides interfaces and classes for calculating (geodesic) distances and shortest paths.  Currently includes:
<ul>
<li/><code>DijkstraDistance</code>: finds the distances from a specified source vertex to other vertices in a 
weighted graph with no negative cycles
<li/><code>DijkstraShortestPath</code>: extends <code>DijkstraDistance</code>, also finds shortest paths
<li/><code>Distance</code>: an interface for defining vertex-vertex distances
<li/><code>PrimMinimumSpanningTree</code>: identifies the spanning tree for a graph of least total edge weight
<li/><code>ShortestPath</code>: an interface for shortest-path algorithms
<li/><code>ShortestPathUtils</code>: utility functions for manipulating shortest paths
<li/><code>UnweightedShortestPath</code>: finds the distances from a specified source vertex to other vertices in an
unweighted graph
</ul>
