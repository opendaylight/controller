/**
 * <p>Calculates distances in a specified graph, using  
 * Dijkstra's single-source-shortest-path algorithm.  All edge weights
 * in the graph must be nonnegative; if any edge with negative weight is 
 * found in the course of calculating distances, an 
 * <code>IllegalArgumentException</code> will be thrown.
 * (Note: this exception will only be thrown when such an edge would be
 * used to update a given tentative distance;
 * the algorithm does not check for negative-weight edges "up front".)
 * 
 * <p>Distances and partial results are optionally cached (by this instance)
 * for later reference.  Thus, if the 10 closest vertices to a specified source 
 * vertex are known, calculating the 20 closest vertices does not require 
 * starting Dijkstra's algorithm over from scratch.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Distances are stored as double-precision values.  
 * If a vertex is not reachable from the specified source vertex, no 
 * distance is stored.  <b>This is new behavior with version 1.4</b>;
 * the previous behavior was to store a value of 
 * <code>Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY</code>.  This change gives the algorithm
 * an approximate complexity of O(kD log k), where k is either the number of
 * requested targets or the number of reachable vertices (whichever is smaller),
 * and D is the average degree of a vertex.</p>
 * 
 * <p> The elements in the maps returned by <code>getDistanceMap</code> 
 * are ordered (that is, returned 
 * by the iterator) by nondecreasing distance from <code>source</code>.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Users are cautioned that distances calculated should be assumed to
 * be invalidated by changes to the graph, and should invoke <code>reset()</code>
 * when appropriate so that the distances can be recalculated.</p>
