Mechanisms for assigning values (denoting significance, influence, centrality, etc.)
to graph elements based on topological properties.  These include:

<ul>
<li/><code>BarycenterScorer</code>: assigns a score to each vertex according to 
the sum of the distances to all other vertices
<li/><code>ClosenessCentrality</code>: assigns a score to each vertex based on 
the mean distance to each other vertex
<li/><code>DegreeScorer</code>: assigns a score to each vertex based on its degree
<li/><code>EigenvectorCentrality</code>: assigns vertex scores based on 
long-term probabilities of random walks passing through the vertex at time t
<li/><code>PageRank</code>: like <code>EigenvectorCentrality</code>, but with 
a constant probability of the
random walk restarting at a uniform-randomly chosen vertex
<li/><code>PageRankWithPriors</code>: like <code>PageRank</code>, but with a 
constant probability of the random
walk restarting at a vertex drawn from an arbitrary distribution
<li/><code>HITS</code>: assigns hubs-and-authorities scores to vertices based on 
complementary random walk processes
<li/><code>HITSWithPriors</code>: analogous to <code>HITS</code> 
(see <code>PageRankWithPriors</code>)
<li/><code>VoltageScorer</code>: assigns scores to vertices based on simulated 
current flow along edges
</ul>
