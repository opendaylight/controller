See: http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/config/filter.html#CORS_Filter
And: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing
This is done to allow a web page using javascript to be able to make calls
to our REST APIs even though it does not originate in our domain.

This bundle just rolls up org.apache.catalina.filters.CorsFilter and adds it as a 
fragment to the org.apache.catalina bundle.

The reason this is necessary is because the CorsFilter class was originally added
at Tomcat 7.0.42, and we are using 7.0.32.  As the CorsFilter class is a simple one,
with very few dependencies, this seemed the best way to bring it in.
