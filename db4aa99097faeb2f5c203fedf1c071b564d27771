      "message": "Hi Robert - this change was actually necessary because when the java class is created by xtend the generics are set up in such a way that the eclipse compiler fails to compile properly. This is happening because the eclipse compiler was treating NotificationListener\u003c?\u003e and NotificationListener\u003c? extends Object\u003e as different typing. The first being a completely unknown type, the second being a type which at least extends Object. While we can assert that is always true in the java world, the eclipse compiler doesn\u0027t seem to be that smart. :)\n\nBy making this change here we allow the eclipse compiler to pass the compilation of the generated extend file.",
