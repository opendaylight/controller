      "message": "Usability Comment - I think we have too many methods that may contain changed data here.\n\nWhen I think of an event, I think of a BEFORE state, CURRENT state, and possibly an update type which tells you what type (CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE). But even then, the TYPE can be inferred via the state. That is, no state before, and now there  is a state means CREATE, existing state, new state, update, exiting state, no state, delete. \n\nCan we simplify the methods to get data down to just two - get priorState getNewState? Seems like it would be easier to understand.\n\nWe should capture this usability comment and discuss and if a change is determined worth wild, change in another patch.",
