      "message": "The formatting stuffs \u0026lt;, \u0026#x20; makes it extremely hard to read the example.\nBut, I understand the  intention behind such a change. It aids in the auto-generated Enunciate REST-API documentation.\n\nBut, the \u003cpre\u003e tag can tolerate white-spaces and am surprised that we had to spoon feed it.\n\nThis seems like an Enunciate bug which removes White-spaces.\nSo, with the pros \u0026 cons, I am okay to leave these formatting changes in place. Once we get a chance to resolve these Enunciate issues, we can simply search \u0026 replace all these formatting fixes and hence the Docs can be intact.",
