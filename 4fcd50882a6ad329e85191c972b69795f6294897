      "message": "I changed it to use Cache mainly for thread safety. Even though all Shard actors are currently created on startup, due to async nature of akka, I think they may still be created on separate threads.  Also, in the future, we\u0027ll likely support dynamic creation of Shards and maybe removal so this sets us up for that. Usage of weakValues will cleanup stale beans from the map on config module restart.",
