      "message": "If the semaphore isn\u0027t acquired, i.e. at least 1 shard didn\u0027t elect a leader, should we proceed with startup knowing transactions will fail? We could throw an exception back to the config system although not sure how it would handle it. Maybe the config system tries again later or could be enhanced to do so. \n\nAnother option is to loop forever until it succeeds. \n\nWe can think about this and refine it later.",
