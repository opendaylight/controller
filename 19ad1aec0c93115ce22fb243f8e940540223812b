      "message": "You should combine the above two lines.\nThe first one is a dead store.\n\n boolean flowInstalled \u003d !target.installInHw();\n\nBTW, why are you storing the config field that says if the user wanted this config to be applied or not in hw ?\nThat field is already available at any time from target.\n\nWhat you are interested into is whether the user requested an uninstall or an install.\nWhich you already know because it depends on target.installInHw(), given this function is for toggling the flow to/from hw.\n\nSo, when this toggling function is called, it checks the current static flow config to see if current wanted status is \"flow in sw only\" or \"flow installed on the switch\".\n\nIn case of the former, it will attempt to install on hw. If installation is successful, it will update the config object: installInHw -\u003e true.\n\nIn case of the latter, it will attempt to uninstall the flow from hw. If operation is successful, it will update the config object: installInHw -\u003e false.\n\nThis is what the current code is already doing.\n\nIf you still want to add your change, if you feel it improves readability, I am ok with it.\nBut please change the boolean variable setting to:\n\nboolean wasInstalled \u003d target.installInHw().\n\nAlso please correct the indentation of the curly braces and follow existing file convention where else is on same line of closing brace.",

      "message": "Hi Alessandro,\n\nIt\u0027s correct that I can get whether user requested uninstall or an install from target.installInHw() and the existing code flow is also correct. \n\nThe issue that I found out is, when the uninstallFlowEntry() function is called, toggleInstallation() function is called which sets the value of installInHw as false. \n\nAfter coming out of this function, based on the success, toggleInstallation() is called again which reverses the value of installInHW as true. This is incorrect.\n\nThus, the button on UI is not changed from Uninstall Flow -\u003e Install Flow though it is uninstalled because the value of installInHW is still true. \n\nThe change that I made works on the basis of explicitly setting the installInHw in the case of uninstall and install flow.\n\nThus, if the operation is uninstall the value of installInHW -\u003e false  and true otherwise. Apart from improving readibility it resolves the issue that I mentioned above.",
