      "message": "We need to find more suitable place for the constants outside of netconf-api. Also the property key \"name\" should be extracted somewhere. \n\nThinking of a better solution to this problem: What if we defined a marker interface (or a subinterface of NetconfOperationServiceFactory) somewhere in mapping-api and the serviceFactories intended for config subsystem would implement that. Check would be then performed using instanceof.\n\nPlease add a TODO here so we can deal with it later.",
