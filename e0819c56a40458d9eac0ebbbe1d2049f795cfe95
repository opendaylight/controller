      "message": "Wehl... it\u0027s a test which ensures non-regression on a test utility.  Which is useful, don\u0027t you think?  To me, this is basically the same as test of any other utility helper class. It just happens that this utility helper class is for writing tests - but that is not relevant to \"why is this tested\".  Everything should be tested. ;-)\n\nWhat I would agree with it that the test is extremely basic, just non null; not real functionality. That is intentional, because the point is more to make sure the initialisation works and doesn\u0027t throw exceptions, and (in this case) trust that if it does return a DataBroker, it is a working one.",
