What bothers me is that, in this method, iteration order is significant, but the signature doesn’t indicate that: I can provide a unstable Set, and the results will be different on each call. I don’t really have an answer apart from that List is typically used when the order of a collection is important.\n\nI don’t want to hold up this fix though ;-).\n\n \u003e There really is no semantic difference between the two.
