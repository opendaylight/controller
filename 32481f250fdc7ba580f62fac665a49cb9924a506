      "message": "Should we use the derived actor\u0027s class here (e.g. Shard)? This results in a lot of duplicate logging as RaftActor and Shard pretty much log something on every message. This particularly produces a lot of unnecessary extra output with heartbeats. Maybe we should use the AbstractUntypedPersistentActor class here and print the actor name in each log message for identification.",
