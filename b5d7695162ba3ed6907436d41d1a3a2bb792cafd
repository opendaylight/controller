      "message": "I have a problem with this. I want the available permits to match the mailbox size.\n\nI think this batching is fine but we need to aquire 1 permit when we do an operation and release \u0027n\u0027 permits when we finish a batch operation. The \u0027n\u0027 count can be put in the BatchedModification response. We are not doing this today - is this why you want to increase the number of available permits?\n\nOne reason I have a problem with allowing more permits is that I think we may find ourselves overloaded with the batching. I believe the batching optimization will improve performance simply by reducing the roundtrips and we should have better performance despite the existing throttling without increasing the available permits.",
