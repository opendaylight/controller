Should we reference a locally generated p2 site rather than remote?  Or whom is going to maintain the main one if remote?",

In this way every time there will be a fresh P2 repository and folks don\u0027t have to worry to mantain it because will be maintained by the jenkins.\n\nIf someone wants to generate a different target with it\u0027s own repo it can be free to do it, but it needs to create it\u0027s own. Here i\u0027m setting up a target-platform for general use.",
