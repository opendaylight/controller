      "message": "I don\u0027t think it\u0027s safe quite yet to remove these. These come from the persisted journal and it\u0027s possible there could be a lingering one if the shard hasn\u0027t reached the snapshot point yet. This was the reason I didn\u0027t remove the deprecated He payload classes yet. I think one more release for these as well wouldn\u0027t hurt. So keep this patch around for later.",
