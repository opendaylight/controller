      "message": "So for a nested list, e.g.\n\n  container outer {\n      list inner-list {\n      }\n  }\n\nIt seems for ensure parents,  restconf would pass in:\n\n  \u003couter\u003e\n      \u003cinner-list/\u003e\n  \u003c/outer\u003e\n\nand the path would have 2 args so this check would let it thru. Would this cause the same issue or, based on your comment, the empty \u003cinner-list\u003e would not get serialized to the device?",
