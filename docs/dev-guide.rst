Controller
==========

Overview
--------

OpenDaylight Controller is Java-based, model-driven controller using
YANG as its modeling language for various aspects of the system and
applications and with its components serves as a base platform for other
OpenDaylight applications.

The OpenDaylight Controller relies on the following technologies:

-  **OSGI** - This framework is the back-end of OpenDaylight as it
   allows dynamically loading of bundles and packages JAR files, and
   binding bundles together for exchanging information.

-  **Karaf** - Application container built on top of OSGI, which
   simplifies operational aspects of packaging and installing
   applications.

-  **YANG** - a data modeling language used to model configuration and
   state data manipulated by the applications, remote procedure calls,
   and notifications.

The OpenDaylight Controller provides following model-driven subsystems
as a foundation for Java applications:

-  :ref:`MD-SAL <mdsal_dev_guide>` - messaging and data storage
   functionality for data, notifications and RPCs modeled by application
   developers. MD-SAL uses YANG as the modeling for both interface and
   data definitions, and provides a messaging and data-centric runtime
   for such services based on YANG modeling.

-  **MD-SAL Clustering** - enables cluster support for core MD-SAL
   functionality and provides location-transparent accesss to
   YANG-modeled data.

The OpenDaylight Controller supports external access to applications and
data using following model-driven protocols:

-  **NETCONF** - XML-based RPC protocol, which provides abilities for
   client to invoke YANG-modeled RPCs, receive notifications and to
   read, modify and manipulate YANG modeled data.

-  **RESTCONF** - HTTP-based protocol, which provides REST-like APIs to
   manipulate YANG modeled data and invoke YANG modeled RPCs, using XML
   or JSON as payload format.

MD-SAL Overview
---------------

The Model-Driven Service Adaptation Layer (MD-SAL) is message-bus
inspired extensible middleware component that provides messaging and
data storage functionality based on data and interface models defined by
application developers (i.e. user-defined models).

The MD-SAL:

-  Defines a **common-layer, concepts, data model building blocks and
   messaging patterns** and provides infrastructure / framework for
   applications and inter-application communication.

-  Provide common support for user-defined transport and payload
   formats, including payload serialization and adaptation (e.g. binary,
   XML or JSON).

The MD-SAL uses **YANG** as the modeling language for both interface and
data definitions, and provides a messaging and data-centric runtime for
such services based on YANG modeling.

| The MD-SAL provides two different API types (flavours):

-  **MD-SAL Binding:** MD-SAL APIs which extensively uses APIs and
   classes generated from YANG models, which provides compile-time
   safety.

-  **MD-SAL DOM:** (Document Object Model) APIs which uses DOM-like
   representation of data, which makes them more powerful, but provides
   less compile-time safety.

.. note::

    Model-driven nature of the MD-SAL and **DOM**-based APIs allows for
    behind-the-scene API and payload type mediation and transformation
    to facilitate seamless communication between applications - this
    enables for other components and applications to provide connectors
    / expose different set of APIs and derive most of its functionality
    purely from models, which all existing code can benefit from without
    modification. For example **RESTCONF Connector** is an application
    built on top of MD-SAL and exposes YANG-modeled application APIs
    transparently via HTTP and adds support for XML and JSON payload
    type.

Basic concepts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Basic concepts are building blocks which are used by applications, and
from which MD-SAL uses to define messaging patterns and to provide
services and behavior based on developer-supplied YANG models.

Data Tree
    All state-related data are modeled and represented as data tree,
    with possibility to address any element / subtree

    -  **Operational Data Tree** - Reported state of the system,
       published by the providers using MD-SAL. Represents a feedback
       loop for applications to observe state of the network / system.

    -  **Configuration Data Tree** - Intended state of the system or
       network, populated by consumers, which expresses their intention.

Instance Identifier
    Unique identifier of node / subtree in data tree, which provides
    unambiguous information, how to reference and retrieve node /
    subtree from conceptual data trees.

Notification
    Asynchronous transient event which may be consumed by subscribers
    and they may act upon it

RPC
    asynchronous request-reply message pair, when request is triggered
    by consumer, send to the provider, which in future replies with
    reply message.

    .. note::

        In MD-SAL terminology, the term *RPC* is used to define the
        input and output for a procedure (function) that is to be
        provided by a provider, and mediated by the MD-SAL, that means
        it may not result in remote call.

Messaging Patterns
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MD-SAL provides several messaging patterns using broker derived from
basic concepts, which are intended to transfer YANG modeled data between
applications to provide data-centric integration between applications
instead of API-centric integration.

-  **Unicast communication**

   -  **Remote Procedure Calls** - unicast between consumer and
      provider, where consumer sends **request** message to provider,
      which asynchronously responds with **reply** message

-  **Publish / Subscribe**

   -  **Notifications** - multicast transient message which is published
      by provider and is delivered to subscribers

   -  **Data Change Events** - multicast asynchronous event, which is
      sent by data broker if there is change in conceptual data tree,
      and is delivered to subscribers

-  **Transactional access to Data Tree**

   -  Transactional **reads** from conceptual **data tree** - read-only
      transactions with isolation from other running transactions.

   -  Transactional **modification** to conceptual **data tree** - write
      transactions with isolation from other running transactions.

   -  **Transaction chaining**

MD-SAL Data Transactions
------------------------

MD-SAL **Data Broker** provides transactional access to conceptual
**data trees** representing configuration and operational state.

.. note::

    **Data tree** usually represents state of the modeled data, usually
    this is state of controller, applications and also external systems
    (network devices).

**Transactions** provide :ref:`stable and isolated
view <transaction_isolation>` from other currently running
transactions. The state of running transaction and underlying data tree
is not affected by other concurrently running transactions.

Write-Only
    Transaction provides only modification capabilities, but does not
    provide read capabilities. Write-only transaction is allocated using
    ``newWriteOnlyTransaction()``.

    .. note::

        This allows less state tracking for write-only transactions and
        allows MD-SAL Clustering to optimize internal representation of
        transaction in cluster.

Read-Write
    Transaction provides both read and write capabilities. It is
    allocated using ``newReadWriteTransaction()``.

Read-Only
    Transaction provides stable read-only view based on current data
    tree. Read-only view is not affected by any subsequent write
    transactions. Read-only transaction is allocated using
    ``newReadOnlyTransaction()``.

    .. note::

        If an application needs to observe changes itself in data tree,
        it should use **data tree listeners** instead of read-only
        transactions and polling data tree.

Transactions may be allocated using the **data broker** itself or using
**transaction chain**. In the case of **transaction chain**, the new
allocated transaction is not based on current state of data tree, but
rather on state introduced by previous transaction from the same chain,
even if the commit for previous transaction has not yet occurred (but
transaction was submitted).

Write-Only & Read-Write Transaction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Write-Only and Read-Write transactions provide modification capabilities
for the conceptual data trees.

1. application allocates new transactions using
   ``newWriteOnlyTransaction()`` or ``newReadWriteTransaction()``.

2. application `modifies data tree <#_modification_of_data_tree>`__
   using ``put``, ``merge`` and/or ``delete``.

3. application finishes transaction using
   ``submit()``, which :ref:`seals transaction
   and submits <submitting_transaction>` it to be processed.

4. application observes the result of the transaction commit using
   either blocking or asynchronous calls.

The **initial state** of the write transaction is a **stable snapshot**
of the current data tree state captured when transaction was created and
it’s state and underlying data tree are not affected by other
concurrently running transactions.

Write transactions are **isolated** from other concurrent write
transactions. All :ref:`writes are local <transaction_local_state>`
to the transaction and represents only a **proposal of state change**
for data tree and **are not visible** to any other concurrently running
transactions (including read-only transactions).

The transaction :ref:`commit may fail <commit_failure_scenarios>` due
to failing verification of data or concurrent transaction modifying and
affected data in an incompatible way.

Modification of Data Tree
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Write-only and read-write transaction provides following methods to
modify data tree:

put
    .. code:: java

        <T> void put(LogicalDatastoreType store, InstanceIdentifier<T> path, T data);

    Stores a piece of data at a specified path. This acts as an **add /
    replace** operation, which is to say that whole subtree will be
    replaced by the specified data.

merge
    .. code:: java

        <T> void merge(LogicalDatastoreType store, InstanceIdentifier<T> path, T data);

    Merges a piece of data with the existing data at a specified path.
    Any **pre-existing data** which are not explicitly overwritten
    **will be preserved**. This means that if you store a container, its
    child subtrees will be merged.

delete
    .. code:: java

        void delete(LogicalDatastoreType store, InstanceIdentifier<?> path);

    Removes a whole subtree from a specified path.

.. _submitting_transaction:

Submitting transaction
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Transaction is submitted to be processed and committed using following
method:

.. code:: java

    CheckedFuture<Void,TransactionCommitFailedException> submit();

Applications publish the changes proposed in the transaction by calling
``submit()`` on the transaction. This **seals the transaction**
(preventing any further writes using this transaction) and submits it to
be processed and applied to global conceptual data tree. The
``submit()`` method does not block, but rather returns
``ListenableFuture``, which will complete successfully once processing
of transaction is finished and changes are applied to data tree. If
**commit** of data failed, the future will fail with
``TransactionFailedException``.

Application may listen on commit state asynchronously using
``ListenableFuture``.

.. code:: java

    Futures.addCallback( writeTx.submit(), new FutureCallback<Void>() {
            public void onSuccess( Void result ) {
                LOG.debug("Transaction committed successfully.");
            }

            public void onFailure( Throwable t ) {
                LOG.error("Commit failed.",e);
            }
        });

-  Submits ``writeTx`` and registers application provided
   ``FutureCallback`` on returned future.

-  Invoked when future completed successfully - transaction ``writeTx``
   was successfully committed to data tree.

-  Invoked when future failed - commit of transaction ``writeTx``
   failed. Supplied exception provides additional details and cause of
   failure.

If application need to block till commit is finished it may use
``checkedGet()`` to wait till commit is finished.

.. code:: java

    try {
        writeTx.submit().checkedGet();
    } catch (TransactionCommitFailedException e) {
        LOG.error("Commit failed.",e);
    }

-  Submits ``writeTx`` and blocks till commit of ``writeTx`` is
   finished. If commit fails ``TransactionCommitFailedException`` will
   be thrown.

-  Catches ``TransactionCommitFailedException`` and logs it.

.. _transaction_local_state:

Transaction local state
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Read-Write transactions maintain transaction-local state, which renders
all modifications as if they happened, but this is only local to
transaction.

Reads from the transaction returns data as if the previous modifications
in transaction already happened.

Let assume initial state of data tree for ``PATH`` is ``A``.

.. code:: java

    ReadWriteTransaction rwTx = broker.newReadWriteTransaction();

    rwRx.read(OPERATIONAL,PATH).get();
    rwRx.put(OPERATIONAL,PATH,B);
    rwRx.read(OPERATIONAL,PATH).get();
    rwRx.put(OPERATIONAL,PATH,C);
    rwRx.read(OPERATIONAL,PATH).get();

-  Allocates new ``ReadWriteTransaction``.

-  Read from ``rwTx`` will return value ``A`` for ``PATH``.

-  Writes value ``B`` to ``PATH`` using ``rwTx``.

-  Read will return value ``B`` for ``PATH``, since previous write
   occurred in same transaction.

-  Writes value ``C`` to ``PATH`` using ``rwTx``.

-  Read will return value ``C`` for ``PATH``, since previous write
   occurred in same transaction.

.. _transaction_isolation:

Transaction isolation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Running (not submitted) transactions are isolated from each other and
changes done in one transaction are not observable in other currently
running transaction.

Lets assume initial state of data tree for ``PATH`` is ``A``.

.. code:: java

    ReadOnlyTransaction txRead = broker.newReadOnlyTransaction();
    ReadWriteTransaction txWrite = broker.newReadWriteTransaction();

    txRead.read(OPERATIONAL,PATH).get();
    txWrite.put(OPERATIONAL,PATH,B);
    txWrite.read(OPERATIONAL,PATH).get();
    txWrite.submit().get();
    txRead.read(OPERATIONAL,PATH).get();
    txAfterCommit = broker.newReadOnlyTransaction();
    txAfterCommit.read(OPERATIONAL,PATH).get();

-  Allocates read only transaction, which is based on data tree which
   contains value ``A`` for ``PATH``.

-  Allocates read write transaction, which is based on data tree which
   contains value ``A`` for ``PATH``.

-  Read from read-only transaction returns value ``A`` for ``PATH``.

-  Data tree is updated using read-write transaction, ``PATH`` contains
   ``B``. Change is not public and only local to transaction.

-  Read from read-write transaction returns value ``B`` for ``PATH``.

-  Submits changes in read-write transaction to be committed to data
   tree. Once commit will finish, changes will be published and ``PATH``
   will be updated for value ``B``. Previously allocated transactions
   are not affected by this change.

-  Read from previously allocated read-only transaction still returns
   value ``A`` for ``PATH``, since it provides stable and isolated view.

-  Allocates new read-only transaction, which is based on data tree,
   which contains value ``B`` for ``PATH``.

-  Read from new read-only transaction return value ``B`` for ``PATH``
   since read-write transaction was committed.

.. note::

    Examples contain blocking calls on future only to illustrate that
    action happened after other asynchronous action. The use of the
    blocking call ``ListenableFuture#get()`` is discouraged for most
    use-cases and you should use
    ``Futures#addCallback(ListenableFuture, FutureCallback)`` to listen
    asynchronously for result.

.. _commit_failure_scenarios:

Commit failure scenarios
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A transaction commit may fail because of following reasons:

Optimistic Lock Failure
    Another transaction finished earlier and **modified the same node in
    a non-compatible way**. The commit (and the returned future) will
    fail with an ``OptimisticLockFailedException``.

    It is the responsibility of the caller to create a new transaction
    and submit the same modification again in order to update data tree.

    .. warning::

        ``OptimisticLockFailedException`` usually exposes **multiple
        writers** to the same data subtree, which may conflict on same
        resources.

        In most cases, retrying may result in a probability of success.

        There are scenarios, albeit unusual, where any number of retries
        will not succeed. Therefore it is strongly recommended to limit
        the number of retries (2 or 3) to avoid an endless loop.

Data Validation
    The data change introduced by this transaction **did not pass
    validation** by commit handlers or data was incorrectly structured.
    The returned future will fail with a
    ``DataValidationFailedException``. User **should not retry** to
    create new transaction with same data, since it probably will fail
    again.

Example conflict of two transactions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This example illustrates two concurrent transactions, which derived from
same initial state of data tree and proposes conflicting modifications.

.. code:: java

    WriteTransaction txA = broker.newWriteTransaction();
    WriteTransaction txB = broker.newWriteTransaction();

    txA.put(CONFIGURATION, PATH, A);
    txB.put(CONFIGURATION, PATH, B);

    CheckedFuture<?,?> futureA = txA.submit();
    CheckedFuture<?,?> futureB = txB.submit();

-  Updates ``PATH`` to value ``A`` using ``txA``

-  Updates ``PATH`` to value ``B`` using ``txB``

-  Seals & submits ``txA``. The commit will be processed asynchronously
   and data tree will be updated to contain value ``A`` for ``PATH``.
   The returned ‘ListenableFuture’ will complete successfully once state
   is applied to data tree.

-  Seals & submits ``txB``. Commit of ``txB`` will fail, because
   previous transaction also modified path in a concurrent way. The
   state introduced by ``txB`` will not be applied. The returned
   ``ListenableFuture`` will fail with ``OptimisticLockFailedException``
   exception, which indicates that concurrent transaction prevented the
   submitted transaction from being applied.

Example asynchronous retry-loop
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code:: java

    private void doWrite( final int tries ) {
        WriteTransaction writeTx = dataBroker.newWriteOnlyTransaction();

        MyDataObject data = ...;
        InstanceIdentifier<MyDataObject> path = ...;
        writeTx.put( LogicalDatastoreType.OPERATIONAL, path, data );

        Futures.addCallback( writeTx.submit(), new FutureCallback<Void>() {
            public void onSuccess( Void result ) {
                // succeeded
            }

            public void onFailure( Throwable t ) {
                if( t instanceof OptimisticLockFailedException && (( tries - 1 ) > 0)) {
                    doWrite( tries - 1 );
                }
            }
          });
    }
    ...
    doWrite( 2 );

Concurrent change compatibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are several sets of changes which could be considered incompatible
between two transactions which are derived from same initial state.
Rules for conflict detection applies recursively for each subtree level.

Following table shows state changes and failures between two concurrent
transactions, which are based on same initial state, ``tx1`` is
submitted before ``tx2``.

INFO: Following tables stores numeric values and shows data using
``toString()`` to simplify examples.

MD-SAL RPC routing
------------------

The MD-SAL provides a way to deliver Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs) to a
particular implementation based on content in the input as it is modeled
in YANG. This part of the RPC input is referred to as a **context
reference**.

The MD-SAL does not dictate the name of the leaf which is used for this
RPC routing, but provides necessary functionality for YANG model author
to define their **context reference** in their model of RPCs.

MD-SAL routing behavior is modeled using following terminology and its
application to YANG models:

Context Type
    Logical type of RPC routing. Context type is modeled as YANG
    ``identity`` and is referenced in model to provide scoping
    information.

Context Instance
    Conceptual location in data tree, which represents context in which
    RPC could be executed. Context instance usually represent logical
    point to which RPC execution is attached.

Context Reference
    Field of RPC input payload which contains Instance Identifier
    referencing **context instance** in which the RPC should be
    executed.

Modeling a routed RPC
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to define routed RPCs, the YANG model author needs to declare
(or reuse) a **context type**, set of possible **context instances** and
finally RPCs which will contain **context reference** on which they will
be routed.

Declaring a routing context type
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code::

    identity node-context {
        description "Identity used to mark node context";
    }

This declares an identity named ``node-context``, which is used as
marker for node-based routing and is used in other places to reference
that routing type.

Declaring possible context instances
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order to define possible values of **context instances** for routed
RPCs, we need to model that set accordingly using ``context-instance``
extension from the ``yang-ext`` model.

.. code::

    import yang-ext { prefix ext; }

    /** Base structure **/
    container nodes {
        list node {
            key "id";
            ext:context-instance "node-context";
            // other node-related fields would go here
        }
    }

The statement ``ext:context-instance "node-context";`` marks any element
of the ``list node`` as a possible valid **context instance** in
``node-context`` based routing.

.. note::

    The existence of a **context instance** node in operational or
    config data tree is not strongly tied to existence of RPC
    implementation.

    For most routed RPC models, there is relationship between the data
    present in operational data tree and RPC implementation
    availability, but this is not enforced by MD-SAL. This provides some
    flexibility for YANG model writers to better specify their routing
    model and requirements for implementations. Details when RPC
    implementations are available should be documented in YANG model.

    If user invokes RPC with a **context instance** that has no
    registered implementation, the RPC invocation will fail with the
    exception ``DOMRpcImplementationNotAvailableException``.

Declaring a routed RPC
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To declare RPC to be routed based on ``node-context`` we need to add
leaf of ``instance-identifier`` type (or type derived from
``instance-identifier``) to the RPC and mark it as **context
reference**.

This is achieved using YANG extension ``context-reference`` from
``yang-ext`` model on leaf, which will be used for RPC routing.

.. code::

    rpc example-routed-rpc  {
        input {
            leaf node {
                ext:context-reference "node-context";
                type "instance-identifier";
            }
            // other input to the RPC would go here
        }
    }

The statement ``ext:context-reference "node-context"`` marks
``leaf node`` as **context reference** of type ``node-context``. The
value of this leaf, will be used by the MD-SAL to select the particular
RPC implementation that registered itself as the implementation of the
RPC for particular **context instance**.

Using routed RPCs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

From a user perspective (e.g. invoking RPCs) there is no difference
between routed and non-routed RPCs. Routing information is just an
additional leaf in RPC which must be populated.

Implementing a routed RPC
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Implementation

Registering implementations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Implementations of a routed RPC (e.g., southbound plugins) will specify
an instance-identifier for the **context reference** (in this case a
node) for which they want to provide an implementation during
registration. Consumers, e.g., those calling the RPC are required to
specify that instance-identifier (in this case the identifier of a node)
when invoking RPC.

Simple code which showcases that for add-flow via Binding-Aware APIs
(`RoutedServiceTest.java <https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/gitweb?p=controller.git;a=blob;f=opendaylight/md-sal/sal-binding-it/src/test/java/org/opendaylight/controller/test/sal/binding/it/RoutedServiceTest.java;h=d49d6f0e25e271e43c8550feb5eef63d96301184;hb=HEAD>`__
):

.. code:: java

     61  @Override
     62  public void onSessionInitiated(ProviderContext session) {
     63      assertNotNull(session);
     64      firstReg = session.addRoutedRpcImplementation(SalFlowService.class, salFlowService1);
     65  }

Line 64: We are registering salFlowService1 as implementation of
SalFlowService RPC

.. code:: java

    107  NodeRef nodeOne = createNodeRef("foo:node:1");
    109  /**
    110   * Provider 1 registers path of node 1
    111   */
    112  firstReg.registerPath(NodeContext.class, nodeOne);

Line 107: We are creating NodeRef (encapsulation of InstanceIdentifier)
for "foo:node:1".

Line 112: We register salFlowService1 as implementation for nodeOne.

The salFlowService1 will be executed only for RPCs which contains
Instance Identifier for foo:node:1.

RPCs and cluster
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In case there is is only a single provider of an RPC in the cluster
the RPC registration is propagated to other nodes via Gossip protocol
and the RPC calls from other nodes are correctly routed to the
provider. Since the registrations are not expected to change rapidly
there is a latency of about 1 second until the registration is reflected
on the remote nodes.


OpenDaylight Controller MD-SAL: RESTCONF
----------------------------------------

RESTCONF operations overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| RESTCONF allows access to datastores in the controller.
| There are two datastores:

-  Config: Contains data inserted via controller

-  Operational: Contains other data

.. note::

    | Each request must start with the URI /rests.
    | RESTCONF listens on port 8080 for HTTP requests.

RESTCONF supports **OPTIONS**, **GET**, **PUT**, **POST**, and
**DELETE** operations. Request and response data can either be in the
XML or JSON format. XML structures according to yang are defined at:
`XML-YANG <https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6020>`__. JSON structures are
defined at:
`JSON-YANG <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-lhotka-netmod-yang-json-02>`__.
Data in the request must have a correctly set **Content-Type** field in
the http header with the allowed value of the media type. The media type
of the requested data has to be set in the **Accept** field. Get the
media types for each resource by calling the OPTIONS operation. Most of
the paths of the pathsRestconf endpoints use `Instance
Identifier <https://wiki-archive.opendaylight.org/view/OpenDaylight_Controller:MD-SAL:Concepts#Instance_Identifier>`__.
``<identifier>`` is used in the explanation of the operations.

| **<identifier>**

-  It must start with <moduleName>:<nodeName> where <moduleName> is a
   name of the module and <nodeName> is the name of a node in the
   module. It is sufficient to just use <nodeName> after
   <moduleName>:<nodeName>. Each <nodeName> has to be separated by /.

-  <nodeName> can represent a data node which is a list or container
   yang built-in type. If the data node is a list, there must be defined
   keys of the list behind the data node name for example,
   <nodeName>=<valueOfKey1>,<valueOfKey2>.

-  | The format <moduleName>:<nodeName> has to be used in this case as
     well:
   | Module A has node A1. Module B augments node A1 by adding node X.
     Module C augments node A1 by adding node X. For clarity, it has to
     be known which node is X (for example: C:X). For more details about
     encoding, see: `RESTCONF RFC 8040 - Encoding YANG Instance Identifiers in
     the Request
     URI. <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8040#section-3.5.3>`__

Mount point
~~~~~~~~~~~

| A Node can be behind a mount point. In this case, the URI has to be in
  format <identifier>/**yang-ext:mount**/<identifier>. The first
  <identifier> is the path to a mount point and the second <identifier>
  is the path to a node behind the mount point. A URI can end in a mount
  point itself by using <identifier>/**yang-ext:mount**.
| More information on how to actually use mountpoints is available at:
  `OpenDaylight
  Controller:Config:Examples:Netconf <https://wiki-archive.opendaylight.org/view/OpenDaylight_Controller:Config:Examples:Netconf>`__.

HTTP methods
~~~~~~~~~~~~

OPTIONS /rests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Returns the XML description of the resources with the required
   request and response media types in Web Application Description
   Language (WADL)

GET /rests/data/<identifier>?content=config
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Returns a data node from the Config datastore.

-  <identifier> points to a data node which must be retrieved.

GET /rests/data/<identifier>?content=nonconfig
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Returns the value of the data node from the non-configuration datastore.

-  <identifier> points to a data node which must be retrieved.

PUT /rests/data/<identifier>
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Updates or creates data in the Config datastore and returns the state
   about success.

-  <identifier> points to a data node which must be stored.

| **Example:**

::

    PUT http://<controllerIP>:8080/rests/data/module1:foo/bar
    Content-Type: applicaton/xml
    <bar>
      …
    </bar>

| **Example with mount point:**

::

    PUT http://<controllerIP>:8080/rests/data/module1:foo1/foo2/yang-ext:mount/module2:foo/bar
    Content-Type: applicaton/xml
    <bar>
      …
    </bar>

POST /rests/data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Creates the data if it does not exist

| For example:

::

    POST URL: http://localhost:8080/rests/data/
    content-type: application/yang.data+json
    JSON payload:

       {
         "toaster:toaster" :
         {
           "toaster:toasterManufacturer" : "General Electric",
           "toaster:toasterModelNumber" : "123",
           "toaster:toasterStatus" : "up"
         }
      }

POST /rests/data/<identifier>
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Creates the data if it does not exist in the Config datastore, and
   returns the state about success.

-  <identifier> points to a data node where data must be stored.

-  The root element of data must have the namespace (data are in XML) or
   module name (data are in JSON.)

| **Example:**

::

    POST http://<controllerIP>:8080/rests/data/module1:foo
    Content-Type: applicaton/xml/
    <bar xmlns=“module1namespace”>
      …
    </bar>

**Example with mount point:**

::

    http://<controllerIP>:8080/rests/data/module1:foo1/foo2/yang-ext:mount/module2:foo
    Content-Type: applicaton/xml
    <bar xmlns=“module2namespace”>
      …
    </bar>

POST /rests/operations/<moduleName>:<rpcName>
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Invokes RPC.

-  <moduleName>:<rpcName> - <moduleName> is the name of the module and
   <rpcName> is the name of the RPC in this module.

-  The Root element of the data sent to RPC must have the name “input”.

-  The result can be the status code or the retrieved data having the
   root element “output”.

| **Example:**

::

    POST http://<controllerIP>:8080/rests/operations/module1:fooRpc
    Content-Type: applicaton/xml
    Accept: applicaton/xml
    <input>
      …
    </input>

    The answer from the server could be:
    <output>
      …
    </output>

| **An example using a JSON payload:**

::

    POST http://localhost:8080/rests/operations/toaster:make-toast
    Content-Type: application/yang.data+json
    {
      "input" :
      {
         "toaster:toasterDoneness" : "10",
         "toaster:toasterToastType":"wheat-bread"
      }
    }

.. note::

    Even though this is a default for the toasterToastType value in the
    yang, you still need to define it.

DELETE /rests/data/<identifier>
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Removes the data node in the Config datastore and returns the state
   about success.

-  <identifier> points to a data node which must be removed.

More information is available in the `RESTCONF
RFC <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8040>`__.

How RESTCONF works
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| RESTCONF uses these base classes:

InstanceIdentifier
    Represents the path in the data tree

ConsumerSession
    Used for invoking RPCs

DataBrokerService
    Offers manipulation with transactions and reading data from the
    datastores

SchemaContext
    Holds information about yang modules

MountService
    Returns MountInstance based on the InstanceIdentifier pointing to a
    mount point

MountInstace
    Contains the SchemaContext behind the mount point

DataSchemaNode
    Provides information about the schema node

SimpleNode
    Possesses the same name as the schema node, and contains the value
    representing the data node value

CompositeNode
    Can contain CompositeNode-s and SimpleNode-s

GET in action
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Figure 1 shows the GET operation with URI rests/data/M:N?content=config
where M is the module name, and N is the node name.

.. figure:: ./images/Get.png
   :alt: Get

   Get

1. The requested URI is translated into the InstanceIdentifier which
   points to the data node. During this translation, the DataSchemaNode
   that conforms to the data node is obtained. If the data node is
   behind the mount point, the MountInstance is obtained as well.

2. RESTCONF asks for the value of the data node from DataBrokerService
   based on InstanceIdentifier.

3. DataBrokerService returns CompositeNode as data.

4. StructuredDataToXmlProvider or StructuredDataToJsonProvider is called
   based on the **Accept** field from the http request. These two
   providers can transform CompositeNode regarding DataSchemaNode to an
   XML or JSON document.

5. XML or JSON is returned as the answer on the request from the client.

PUT in action
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Figure 2 shows the PUT operation with the URI rests/data/M:N where
M is the module name, and N is the node name. Data is sent in the
request either in the XML or JSON format.

.. figure:: ./images/Put.png
   :alt: Put

   Put

1. Input data is sent to JsonToCompositeNodeProvider or
   XmlToCompositeNodeProvider. The correct provider is selected based on
   the Content-Type field from the http request. These two providers can
   transform input data to CompositeNode. However, this CompositeNode
   does not contain enough information for transactions.

2. The requested URI is translated into InstanceIdentifier which points
   to the data node. DataSchemaNode conforming to the data node is
   obtained during this translation. If the data node is behind the
   mount point, the MountInstance is obtained as well.

3. CompositeNode can be normalized by adding additional information from
   DataSchemaNode.

4. RESTCONF begins the transaction, and puts CompositeNode with
   InstanceIdentifier into it. The response on the request from the
   client is the status code which depends on the result from the
   transaction.

Something practical
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Create a new flow on the switch openflow:1 in table 2.
