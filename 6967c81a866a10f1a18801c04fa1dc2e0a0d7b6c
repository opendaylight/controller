      "message": "Although generally this change makes sense, a couple of issues:\n- If the forwarding module fails to install any of its flows, controller ends up handling a bunch of IP traffic in SW.\n- Why is ArpHandler assuming that forwarding module will actually let ALL hosts talk IP? Not all forwarding modules are \"simple\".\n- I think making controller aware of \"apps\" is very tight coupling. Please don\u0027t forget that ODL is a framework.",
