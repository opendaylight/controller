      "message": "I see concepts and yang.common projects. The classes in there do seem related to yang and yang-generated code. The packages names contain yangtools/yang. But this code is related to guava and concurrency and MD-SAL  - It seems strange to me to have it in a yangtools/yang package since it has nothing to do with yang tools or yang. There currently isn\u0027t a general ODL commons util project or bundle but it seems to me sal-common-util is the closest at this point. \n\nWe can discuss this further on the hackers call today. I have other general classes that I have put into sal-common-util as part of another draft.",
