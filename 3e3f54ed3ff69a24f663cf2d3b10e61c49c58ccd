Probably the followerId and leaderIds would help, at the follower end.",

      "message": "What do you mean by does it need to be verbose? There are multiple conditions where we may end up with an Invalid chunk - we could either use separate exceptions or the message could have more information. \n\nI agree the hash codes are probably not going to be useful. But at the same time I do not see much use for the leader and follower id as well in this scenario. All I really need to know is someone is that someone sent an chunk out of order. \n\nToday we do not log these exceptions because we have a way to handle them but we could if we wanted to.",
