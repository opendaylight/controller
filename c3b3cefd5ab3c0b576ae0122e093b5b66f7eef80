      "message": "The call to executeShardOperation above calls FindPrimaryShard on the ShardManager. If there is a local shard, it returns that actor path. However the local shard may not be the leader. In that case, the CreateTransaction message is forwarded to the leader by the local shard. The call to findLocalShard just verifies that there is a local shard, not that it is the leader. So it seems the transactionActor may be remote regardless of whether or not there is a local shard as the local shard may not be the leader. \n\nIt seems we need a way to tell if the transactionActor is local or not.

      "message": "Hi Tom,\nThis is my understanding, hoping i am not wrong.\n\nEven if the local shard replica is not the leader, the Tx actor gets created where the local replica is. The Tx actor makes a write to the local shard replica (which is a Raft Actor). Since the local shard actor not the leader, it will send it to the leader (which is remote). \n\nActorContext#findPrimary returns a local shard (if there is one, leader or not) and the excuteRemoteOperation executes the CreateTransaction message on this shard, which in turns creates a ShardTransaction Actor\n\nSo, it seems, currently the TxActor may or may not be co-located with the leader.\nBug-2194 which has been opened targets this.",
