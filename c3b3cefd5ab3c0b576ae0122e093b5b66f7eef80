      "message": "The call to executeShardOperation above calls FindPrimaryShard on the ShardManager. If there is a local shard, it returns that actor path. However the local shard may not be the leader. In that case, the CreateTransaction message is forwarded to the leader by the local shard. The call to findLocalShard just verifies that there is a local shard, not that it is the leader. So it seems the transactionActor may be remote regardless of whether or not there is a local shard as the local shard may not be the leader. \n\nIt seems we need a way to tell if the transactionActor is local or not. I\u0027m not sure if akka provides such functionality.\n\nUnless I\u0027m wrong and missing something here...",
