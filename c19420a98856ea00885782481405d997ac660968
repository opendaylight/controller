      "message": "It looks like the MockFollower class was created simply to add utility methods to it. Since Follower is the subject under test and it is not \"abstract\" ideally we should not need to extend it to test it. I think it would be better if these utility methods are moved out.",

      "message": "The only reason of adding this MockFollower class is that, the \u0027snapshotChunksCollected\u0027 in Follower is a private variable, so I m unable to modify it. To modify it, I need to add getter and setter in the Follower.java. To avoid that, I created this MockFollower.java and made the variable public so that it can be easily modified and tested out. If you still want me to remove MockFollower, I have to change Follower.java. Let me know.",
