Essentially the problem occurs if mdsal.git defines an odl-mdsal-foo feature, which is fully within its namespace.\n\nWe have had this problem with odl-mdsal-common, which was defined in both mdsal and controller -- and the latter was renamed to odl-controller-mdsal-common and still lives in this directory.\n\nGoing forward we want to eliminate this sort of issues by naming features odl-\u003cproject\u003e-whatever, hence my request for a different name.",
