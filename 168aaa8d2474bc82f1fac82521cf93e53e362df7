      "message": "The StatusJsonBean represent the status of a configuration request (POST). Either is succesfull or not and in the second  case a reason of failure is carried. I do not see a need for this object to carry a privilege information. If the configuration was denied because of a not-enough privilege reason, the message string  will carry this information.\n\nThe privilege to be passed to the front-end is merely for presentation on existing resources (GET), so that front-end can show the appropriate control buttons on this resources for the current user.",

Given ODL code does not even provide a bundle for creating containers and given the existing method which I remove is of doubt use, I thought it was ok at this stage of the project to skip the version bump.\n\nPlease let me know if you think otherwise, I can take of the version stuff.",
