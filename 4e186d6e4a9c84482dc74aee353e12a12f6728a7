      "message": "Not trying to nitpick but there\u0027s no point in handling it here for the serverConfigurationSupport if we\u0027re just going to return. If that\u0027s the case then I think it\u0027s cleaner to move the if(serverConfigurationSupport.handleMessage(...)) clause to the top of this method (and remove it from the bottom of the method), i.e.:\n\nif(snapshotSupport.handleSnapshotMessage(message)) {\n    return;\n} else if(message instanceof ApplyState) {\n}\n...\n\nThis is what I had suggested initially. The reason to handle it here would be to execute the rest of the code in this block while eliding the applyState call. However I don\u0027t think we need to do this.",
