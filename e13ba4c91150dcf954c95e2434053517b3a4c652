      "message": "Good point. Even if it was Serializable, would it be correct to try to apply a DataTreeModification on a remote shard that was created from this local shard\u0027s DataTree?\n\nPerhaps we could throw back a transient exception to convey to the front end to retry from scratch, i.e. create a new TransactionProxy/TransactionComponent. It may have to revert the DataTreeModification back to the original write/merge/delete operations if that\u0027s possible. Or something like that.",
