      "message": "package protected usage is very unrecommended and uncommon in Java.\nit should be private/public/protected.\n\nFew reasons for that:\n1. you might want to do inheritance, and if your subclass happens to be in another package, it won\u0027t be able to access those package protected variables.\n2. tests can be in a different package, and then you won\u0027t be able to test the code\n3. future refactor may separate the packages in a different way, and it will break the access to the modifiers - very fragile.\n4. the code, especially implementations should be agnostic as to whether they run in osgi/spring/plain java. the code should decide whether something is visible to other code or not without knowing if it\u0027s wrapped in osgi. osgi in this case offers another level of protection, so the public things can actually be not exported. but that again is not matter of the code. code should not care in which package it is and not be influenced by that.\n\nso based on that, can you recommend what is the best access level? I still think it would be public since it has to be accessed by another class, and one that doesn\u0027t access it through inheritance.",
