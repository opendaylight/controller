      "message": "package protected usage is very unrecommended and uncommon in Java.\nit should be private/public/protected.\n\nFew reasons for that:\n1. you might want to do inheritance, and if your subclass happens to be in another package, it won\u0027t be able to access those package protected variables.\n2. tests can be in a different package, and then you won\u0027t be able to test the code\n3. future refactor may separate the packages in a different way, and it will break the access to the modifiers - very fragile.\n4. the code, especially implementations should be agnostic as to whether they run in osgi/spring/plain java. the code should decide whether something is visible to other code or not without knowing if it\u0027s wrapped in osgi. osgi in this case offers another level of protection, so the public things can actually be not exported. but that again is not matter of the code. code should not care in which package it is and not be influenced by that.\n\nso based on that, can you recommend what is the best access level? I still think it would be public since it has to be accessed by another class, and one that doesn\u0027t access it through inheritance.",

      "message": "Thanks Alissa for the explanation.\n\nI hear you about the inheritance. A bit more skeptical about the activator running in another package. \n\nThe reason why this constant was defined was because it needs to be visible by the activator class. And should not be visible to anybody else, given it provide the internal name of cluster cache used by TM.\nIf there was no activator, then there wouldn\u0027t even be this constant or it would be private.\nThese constants should not be accessed by any other class.\n\nI understand the general approach, but I think we should not miss the purpose of the code while cleaning it up.\n\nThere was a reason for making it package protected only.\nAnd AFAIK in OO the approach to follow for visibility is to choose the lowest grade of visibility that your code needs.\n\nI can see the case where a subclass could be interested in this cache update, so in that case it would need to know the cache name.\n\n\nSo, since you asked me, then I am ok if you make this constant protected.",
