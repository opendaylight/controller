      "message": "Hi Moiz, why is this needed ?\n\nWe associate a name to a FlowEntry request, which a application module ask FRM to install. The flow entry name is unique in the application context. And it is meant for the application use.\n\nThe Flow class is the bare representation (and supposed to be the closest minimal representation) of the Flow which will be installed on the hardware and which the switch will return to us when we query for flow statistics.\n\nThere is no concept of flow name in openflow.\n\nIf another SDN protocol expects a string identifier for the flow, then agree we could add it.\n\nI understand this field is not taken into account into hashcode and equals, neither for marshalling. But I would like to understand the need for this to see if there is another viable solution.\n\nThanks,\nAlessandro",

      "message": "Hi Moiz, I seem to understand you only need a place to store the URI format id for the node and needs to be of string type.\n\nWhat about to modify the Flow.id field from long to String ?\nI think that would fit your need.\n\nAt the end I believe it is preferable to have that id as string so that is more generic and can be of better use for different SDN protocols. Having it as long is probably too openflow specific.\n\nMoreover as of now I doubt is being used/set by anybody.",
