      "message": "There is a \"small\" edge case here where two concurrent calls one after another could result in duplicate entries (one over writing the other). You can avoid this with the \"putIfAbsent\" method on the concurrent map, or locking on an object here when you get / put values.\n\nUltimately I am not 100% that duplicate ping entries (one over writing the other) will cause a problem (still reading on).",
