      "message": "Moiz, I like your approach overall. Since we agreed yesterday no one wants to swap in an alternative replication strategy at this point it seems appropriate to keep your ConsensusStrategy as the main way of having alternative behavior based on config and state.  \n\nTo support the network partition case for 2-Node (really generalized for any size cluster where partitions occur and continued operation is desired) where we want to control how the final shard data is resolved when the partitioned heals I would suggest another “on” method of such as:\n\nenum DataMergeAction {\n\tMERGE,             // Exactly \"how\" is determined by another strategy.\n\tNONE\n}\n\nDataMergeAction onDataMerge(Leader newLeader)",
