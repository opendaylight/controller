      "message": "How about the fact that the move from old JUnit v3 to JUnit v4 at the time intentionally abandoned the old TestCase parent class, and introduced @Rule and @RunWith just because of exactly this design principle? ;-)  \n\nIn practical terms, what people don\u0027t like about test parent classes is that you can have only 1 of them - it makes it hard to mix things.\n\nSome more general articles I found just by Googling for you: \n\n* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_over_inheritance\n\n* https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/composition-vs-inheritance-how-choose\n\n* http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?CompositionInsteadOfInheritance\n\n* https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2013/06/why-favor-composition-over-inheritance-java-oops-design.html\n\n* http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/134097/why-should-i-prefer-composition-over-inheritance\n\n* https://www.petrikainulainen.net/programming/unit-testing/3-reasons-why-we-should-not-use-inheritance-in-our-tests/\n\nHTH.",
