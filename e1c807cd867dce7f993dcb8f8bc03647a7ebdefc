Leadership shouldn\u0027t change that often and primary shard lookups on transitions should be negligible. \n\nIt seems a little funky to me to leak the cache to the ShardManager to have it clear it but have the ActorContext add to it. It seems like the ShardManager could/should be the only one mutating it. In fact we don\u0027t want to cache the ActorSelection for a remote shard b/c we can\u0027t know when it changes. If the ShardManager \"owned\" the cache then it would know not to add a remote shard\u0027s ActorSelection to the cache. \n\nI can look into this.",
