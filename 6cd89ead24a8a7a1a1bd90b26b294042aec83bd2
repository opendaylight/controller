      "message": "I understand the safety aspect of returning an unmodifiable list but I don\u0027t think we need the overhead of being that defensive here. This is not a public API and no callers modify the list and it wouldn\u0027t make sense for them to do so. I\u0027d rather add a javadoc stating not to modify the list rather than incurring the unnecessary overhead of an intermediate object on every call. \n\nThere are other internal classes where we pass/return lists which technically should be immutable but being defensive everywhere gets to be overkill and reduces efficiency.",
