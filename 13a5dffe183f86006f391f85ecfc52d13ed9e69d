      "message": "OK... this is absolutely right structurally.  Naming is still a bit off though.  First, please preface feature with flow- throughout.  Identities are global, so batter to have flow-feature-capbility than feature-capability (there may be other kinds of features).\n\nSecond, please do *not* stick Openflow-isms into the SAL... the OPFC_* are all Openflow-isms.  \n\nSo feature-capability-OFPC-FLOW-STATS should really be something like flow-feature-capability-flow-stats.",
