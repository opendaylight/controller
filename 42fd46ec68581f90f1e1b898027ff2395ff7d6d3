      "message": "The reason I did it this way is to minimize the signatures and transfers to make it easier to add new params. Otherwise we\u0027re back to the pain of props -\u003e Creator -\u003e Shard. I didn\u0027t want an intermediate class passed to Shard. Also the product of the Builder is a Props instance.\n\nSo I think from the client perspective it is a builder and follows the builder pattern. Internally to the Shard it differs a little from the usual builder pattern in that it passes itself to the Shard instead of the params but, again, that was done for the reasons above. \n\nThat said, I can change the name to Params if you want.",
