      "message": "here the doExit will be set to true every time unless an explicit logging.bridge.ignoreUncaughtException is set to \u0027true\" which is the oppsite of the behavior present till now, can we enable the different behavior only if the property is set instead to change the default?\nI\u0027m ok to introduce this behavior but would like to keep the default as it\u0027s.",

      "message": "I think the current behaviour is unsafe -- losing a thread to an uncaught exception means that some random state is lost, which may result in a different part of the controller to fail. Imagine a worker thread dequeing a piece of work and dying while that piece of work is on its stack only. If there is a different thread waiting for that piece to get processed it will never complete.\n\nAnother example would be modifying two collections guarded by a lock -- if an exception is thrown in-between the modification will be incomplete and internal state will be left inconsistent with no real way of ever recovering.",

      "message": "Robert, considering that the controller is not a monolith i don\u0027t think it\u0027s a good practice that on a failure of a component the whole controller kill itself is like if your windows or linux or mac on a failure of your mailer program restart ... that won\u0027t be acceptable. In that case it\u0027s good practice that resilience if spread over the different components. This is on the phylosophical side of the argument. In practice my comment is just not to change the default behavior and i\u0027m ok if a distribution want to use this behavior by setting the system property that is very much acceptable by me just lets not make it default.",

Let\u0027s turn this property into a policy thing, e.g.:\n\ncontroller.uncaughtExceptionPolicy \u003d {IGNORE, SHUTDOWN}\n\nand define a field DEFAULT_UNCAUGHT_EXCEPTION_POLICY \u003d IGNORE. \n\nThat way we have a simple way of changing the default in future without breaking the installed base.",
