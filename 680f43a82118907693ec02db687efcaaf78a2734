But a question.\nIt is cool that we were able to remove the xmlseealso restriction.\nBut, since we are operating in a multiple-projects environment, the  bundles will be loaded dynamically (not during the compile time).\nI guess the BundleScanner will take care of scanning the appropriate classes that are children of Property and adapt the NB-APIs appropriately.\n\nCan you please confirm if this is true ?",
