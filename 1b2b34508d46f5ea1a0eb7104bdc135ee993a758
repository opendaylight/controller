      "message": "There\u0027s different ways to do this. With the current patch, you can see received request counts separately for config and operational but the success and failure counts aren\u0027t separated - they\u0027re both combined for config and operational. I know this is only for GET but it seems a little inconsistent. If I can see separate received request counts for config GET and operational GET then why can\u0027t I see separate success/failure counts for config GET and operational GET? \n\nThe way I would do this is basically what you originally had except without the grouped success and failure counts - these were redundant. So group received-requests, successful-responses and failed-responses together in statistics. To me it seems more natural to see all 3 grouped together per GET, PUT etc rather than having them all spread out, So\n\nConfig\n  Get\n     ReceivedRequests\n     SuccessfulResponses\n     FailedResponses\n  Put\n     ReceivedRequests\n     SuccessfulResponses\n     FailedResponses\n  ..\n\nOperational\n  Get\n     ReceivedRequests\n     SuccessfulResponses\n     FailedResponses",
