      "message": "Based on our discussion , i think it was decided that the portnumber will stay as a union and we would create a separate refactoring task to change it to NodeConnectorId/URI.\nSince a port number can be an int or a string, it made sense to be represented as a union rather than a free-formed string. For a developer the union(int, string) represents more strongly-typed design and becomes self-explanatory about the type of data this model contains.",
