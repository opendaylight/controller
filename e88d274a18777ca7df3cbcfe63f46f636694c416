Without the redundant assertions, you would get a test failure on that line with the NPE and stacktrace.\n\nIt isn\u0027t about saving two lines of code.  It\u0027s about seeing the essential assertions that are important for your business logic.\n\nit\u0027s not likely the test will ever fail.  It\u0027s more likely that this test and its associated CUT will evolve over time, requiring maintenance.
